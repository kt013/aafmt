\section{Hints for ``Group Actions'' exercises}\label{sec:actions:hints} 


\noindent Exercise \ref{exercise:actions:CountingFormula2}(a):   There are two elements.~~(d):   There are three elements.

\noindent Exercise \ref{exercise:actions:Tetra5}(b): It may be helpful to calculate the rotation using cycle notation.

\noindent Exercise \ref{exercise:actions:Octa5a}: How many group elements (rotations) are in $G_{x_+}$?  What else do they stabilize?

\noindent Exercise \ref{exercise:actions:Dodeca5}(b): What is $|G|$ according to the counting formula?  How many stabilizers have we found so far?

\noindent Exercise \ref{exercise:actions:RtCosetAction}: $H$ itself is a coset, and take $g_1=(123)$ and $g_2=(23)$.  Is it true that acting on $H$ by $g_1$ followed by $g_2$ is the same as acting on $H$ by $g_2 g_1$?
