\section{Hints for ``Polynomials and Matrices'' exercises}\label{sec:PolyVec:hints} 


\noindent Exercise \ref{exercise:PolyVec:phi_onto}: Look at the examples of $M=\varphi_m(p(x)$ that we've computed so far, and see how the first column of $M$ relates to the coefficients of $p(x)$.

\noindent Exercise \ref{exercise:PolyVec:propPhi}:  Use the distributive property, exponent rules, and the operation-preserving properties of $\varphi$.
