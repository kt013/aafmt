\section{Diffie Hellman Key Exchange}\label{sec:DHKE:1}

In order to share a private message over a public domain a sender must  "lock" or encrypt their message using a \emph{key}\index{key! in cryptogaphy}.  In cryptography a  key is a special piece of information (usually a number)  that is required to encrypted and decrypt data that is shared between the sender and receiver.  The Diffie Hellman Key Exchange (DHKE) focuses on three types of keys: public, private and symmetric.  A \emph{Public Key}\index{Public Key! in cryptography} can be widely distributed, and is used for encrypting messages.  A\emph{Private Key}\index{Private Key! in cryptography} is only known to the sender, and is used for decrypting messages.  Finally, a \emph{Symmetric Key}\index{Symmetric Key! in cryptography} is known by the sender and receiver, and is used to encypt and decrypt messages.  The security that a key exchange offers is so profound that it is embedded into almost every technology we use today.  Some examples of key exchange can be seen in media applications, cellular phones, banking, and emails. 

So, how do you establish a key?  Looking at this problem from the most fundamental level you would simply tell the other parties what the private key is, but this method is inefficient and is susceptible to eavesdroppers.  So, how do you establish a key over an unsecure network without compromising your data to potential eavesdroppers?  The Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange (DHKE) is one possible solution.  The DHKE is a public key algorithm that is used to establish a key between two parties over an unsecure network.  Note that the DHKE is not used for encryption/decryption of messages, but only to establish a key that can be used to encrypt/decrypt subsequent messages.  

The steps in the DHKE algorithm are as follows (see also Figure~\ref{fig:DH:DHKE_1}):
 \begin{enumerate}[Step 1.]
 \item Prior to sending data, Moses and Rachael agree upon a prime number $p$ and a base number $g$ where $g$ is a primitive root of $p$; 
\item Moses chooses a secret integer $n$, and sends Rachael $ \bmod (g^n , p)$;
\item Rachael chooses a secret integer $m$, and sends Moses  $ \bmod (g^m , p)$;
\item Moses computes $ \bmod ( \bmod (g^m , p)^n , p ) = K_1$;
\item Rachael computes $ \bmod (\bmod (g^n , p)^m , p ) = K_2$;
\end{enumerate} 
\begin{figure}[htb]

	         {images/DHKE_1.png}}
	  \caption{\label{fig:DH:DHKE_1} Key exchange between Moses and Rachael }
\end{figure}
It turns out that when $K_1$ and $K_2$ are computed by the above procedure, then $K_1$ is always equal to $K_2$.  You will show this in the following exercise.

\begin{exer}\\
Fill in the blanks in the following proof that  $K_1$ is always equal to  $K_2$.\\
  	\begin{proof} 
		\begin{align*} 
		K_1 &=   \bmod ( \bmod (g^m , p)^n , p ) 
           	\\&=  \bmod ( \bmod ((g^m)^{\underline{~~~~}} , p) , p )&& \text{(modular arithmetic)}	%ans: \bmod ( \bmod ((g^m)^n , p) , p )&& \text{(modular arithmetic)}
		\\&= \bmod ( \bmod ((g^{mn}) , p) , p )&&  \text{(rules of exponents)}	%ans: \bmod ( \bmod ((g^{mn}) , p) , p )&&  \text{(rules of exponents)}	
           	\\&= \bmod ( \bmod (\underline{~~~~~~}) , p) , p ) &&\text{(rules of exponents)}	%ans: \bmod ( \bmod ((g^{nm}) , p) , p ) &&\text{(rules of exponents)}
           	\\&= \bmod ( \bmod ((\underline{~~~~~~})^m , p) , p )  &&\text{(rules of exponents)}	%ans:  \bmod ( \bmod ((g^n)^m , p) , p )  &&\text{(rules of exponents)}
           	\\&= \bmod ( \bmod ((\underline{~~~~~~} , \underline{~~~~~~})^m , p )&&\text{(modular arithmetic)}   	%ans: \bmod ( \bmod ((g^n , p)^m , p )&&\text{(modular arithmetic)}
		\\&= K_2
		\end{align*} 
   	Thus, $K_1 = K_2 = K$ is the symmetric private key.\\

  	\end{proof}
\end{exer}

In order to make things clearer, we give a simple example to show how key exchange works (note that this example is much too simple to be used in practice, but it does at least show the procedure):

 \begin{eg} Key Exchange between a sender and receiver (Moses and Rachael) using the DHKE is shown in the following steps.
\begin{enumerate}[Step 1.]
\item Prior to sending data, Moses and Rachael agree $p$ = 13 and $g$= 7; 
\item Moses chooses $n$ = 2, and sends Rachael $\bmod (7^2 , 13) = 10$;
\item Rachael chooses $m$ = 8, and sends Moses $\bmod (7^8  , 13) = 3 $;
\item Moses computes $\bmod ((3)^2 , 13 ) = 9$;
\item Rachael computes $\bmod ((10)^8 , 13 ) = 9$;
\item Moses and Rachael share the number 9;
\end{enumerate}
\end{eg}
It is important to choose a large prime number $p$, in order to decrease the chances of an eavesdropper cracking your code.  For example, internet protocols usually use a minimum of a 1024-bit prime number for $p$.  There are $2^{1023}$ different possibilities for 1024 bits (where the highest bit is a `1`), but how can you guarantee that the number is prime?

  \emph{Fermat's Little Theorem}\index{Fermat's Little Theorem! in cryptography} states that if $p$ is a prime number such that $p \nmid a$, and $a$ is an integer, then $1 \equiv \bmod(a^{p-1}, p)$.

\begin{eg} Let $p = 5$ and $a = 1, 2, 3, 4 \text{ and } 5$
$$ 5 \nmid 1 \implies \bmod(1^{5-1}, 5) \equiv 1$$
$$ \bmod(1^{4}, 5) \equiv 1$$
$$ \bmod(1, 5) \equiv 1$$
$$ 5 \nmid 2 \implies \bmod(2^{5-1}, 5) \equiv 1$$
$$ \bmod(2^{4}, 5) \equiv 1$$
$$ \bmod(16, 5) \equiv 1$$
$$ 5 \nmid 3 \implies \bmod(3^{5-1}, 5) \equiv 1$$
$$ \bmod(3^{4}, 5) \equiv 1$$
$$ \bmod(18	, 5) \equiv 1$$
$$ 5 \nmid 4 \implies \bmod(4^{5-1}, 5) \equiv 1$$
$$ \bmod(4^{4}, 5) \equiv 1$$
$$ \bmod(256, 5) \equiv 1$$
$$ 5 | 5 \text { (so the theorem does not apply)}$$
$$ \bmod(5^{5-1}, 5) \equiv 0$$
\end{eg}
Since all values of $a$ such that $1 \leq a \leq p$ are congruent to $1$, then Fermat's Little Theorem tells us that $p$ is prime, but are there numbers that exist that pass Fermat's Little Theorem but are not prime?  The answer is yes, these numbers are called \emph{Lucas-Carmichael Numbers}\index{Lucas-Carmichael Numbers! in cryptogaphy}.  (or \emph{pseudoprimes}\index{Pseudoprimes}) 

Performing exponentiation over a modulus is called \emph{discrete exponentiation}\index{discrete exponentiation! in cryptogaphy} and can quickly become incalculable, however you can overcome this by creating a repeated squaring formula using an excel spreadsheet.  See \emph{Chapter 7.2.3 RSA Exercises, Exercise 36} for instructions on how to create a spreadsheet to compute the following exercises.
 
\begin{exer}
Given $p$ = 32452867; $g$ = 54321; and $n$ = 876.  
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item What number do you send?  
%ans: mod((54321)876, 32,452,867) = 19,439,625

\item You are then sent 31975948, what is the key? 
%ans: K = mod((31,975,948)876, 32,452,867) = 16,045,878

\item If $m$ = 123 what number does the other party calculate?
%ans: K = mod((19,439,625)123, 32,452,867) = 16,045,878
\end{enumerate}
\end{exer}\begin{exer}
Given $p$ = 86028157; $g$ = 98765; and $n$ = 123.  
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item	What number do you send?  
%ans: mod((98765)123, 86,028,157) = 7,262,961

\item You are then sent 53161396, what is the key? 
%ans: K = mod((53,161,396)123, 86,028,157) = 35,164,864

\item If $m$ = 87 what number does the other party calculate?
%ans: K = mod((7,262,961)87, 86,028,157) = 35,164,864
\end{enumerate}
\end{exer}
The security of the DHKE leverages the easy computations of exponentials versus the difficulty of computing logarithms. 
Recall that the logarithm is the inverse operation of exponentiation.  For example, suppose $a = g^m$ , then the Discrete Logarithm (DL) of $a$ = $m$ and is expressed as    $\log_g a = m$.   

\begin{defn} \label{def:DLP}(\emph{Discrete Logarithm Problem})~~
The \emph{discrete logarithm problem}\index{discrete logarithm problem! in cryptogaphy} refers to the difficulty of finding logarithms modulo some integer. For example, $\bmod(2^{m},  11) = 9$ is difficult to solve without computing the results.
$$ \bmod(2^{1}, 11)=2$$
$$ \bmod(2^{2}, 11)=4$$
$$ \bmod(2^{3}, 11)=8$$
$$ \bmod(2^{4}, 11)=5$$
$$ \bmod(2^{5}, 11)=10$$
$$ \bmod(2^{6}, 11)=9$$
$$ \bmod(2^{7}, 11)=7$$
$$ \bmod(2^{8}, 11)=3$$
$$ \bmod(2^{9}, 11)=6$$
$$ \bmod(2^{10}, 11)=1$$

As you can see the results "jump" around, but each solution is equally likely to be any integer between 0 and 11.  Therefore, the larger the modulus the harder it is to solve the discrete logarithm problem.
\end{defn}
\begin{exer}
Use the Repeated Square spreadsheet from the previous Exercise to solve the following Discrete Logarithm Problems.  
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Given $ \bmod(7^{x}, 41)=28$, solve for $x$.
%ans: 29

\item Given $ \bmod(5^{x}, 73)=13$, solve for $x$.
%ans: 59

\item Given $ \bmod(17^{x}, 211)=161$, solve for $x$.
%ans: 161
\end{enumerate}
\end{exer}
Now that we have established that with a large enough modulus the DHKE is infeasable to crack; is there any way to successfully eavesdrop on Moses and Rachael's conversation without actually cracking the code?  Both Moses and Rachael seem confident with the security that the DHKE provides, since an eavesdropper would only be privy to $\mod (g^n , p)$ and $\mod (g^m , p)$ each of which cannot be used to decrypt the message.  An eavesdropper would have to solve the discrete log problem, but what if Fred (an eavesdropper) places himself between Moses and Rachael's messages?  Fred can now establish his own key and is able to read or change messages.  See Figure~\ref{fig:DH:DHKE_2} to see how this works.
\begin{figure}[H]
	   \center{\includegraphics[width=4in]
	         {images/DHKE_2.png}}
	  \caption{\label{fig:DH:DHKE_2} Key exchange between Moses and Rachael }
\end{figure}

 \begin{eg} Key Exchange between a sender and receiver (Moses and Rachael) using the DHKE is shown in the following steps.
\begin{enumerate}[Step 1.]
\item Prior to sending data, Moses and Rachael agree $p$ = 13 and $g$= 7; 
\item Moses chooses $n$ = 2, and sends Rachael $\bmod (7^2 , 13) = 10$;
\item Rachael chooses $m$ = 8, and sends Moses $\bmod (7^8  , 13) = 3 $;
\item Moses computes $\bmod ((3)^2 , 13 ) = 9$;
\item Rachael computes $\bmod ((10)^8 , 13 ) = 9$;
\item Moses and Rachael share the number 9;
\end{enumerate}
\end{eg}

 Fred establishes a secret key $\bmod ( g^nf, p)$ with Moses and another secret key $\bmod ( g^mf, p)$ with Rachael.  DHKE is vulnerable to this type of Man in the Middle (MiM) attack since Moses cannot verify that Rachael was the originator of the message, and vice-versa.  Two possible solutions to the MiM attack are RSA encryption and elliptic curve cryptography. In the next section, we will examin the second of these alternatives. 

\section{Elliptic Curve Cryptography}\label{sec:ECC:2}


Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is one approach to the public key sharing dilemma that offers far more security than the DHKE, RSA, or DSA.  The elliptic curve protocol starts from a given known point called the generator.  A public key is a point on the elliptic curve.  A private key is the number of "hops" the generator must make to arrive at the public key point.  To use ECC we need to restrict ourselves to Finite Fields (FF) also known as Galois Fields (GF).

\subsection{Galois Field} 
As a review, there are three types of algebraic structures: groups, rings, and fields (see Figure~\ref{fig:DH:DHKE_3}); each structure building from the previous structure.  Each structure is defined as a set of elements where: the given operation is closed, has the identity element, has the inverse element, and is associative.
\begin{figure}[H]
	   \center{\includegraphics[width=4in]
	         {images/DHKE_3.png}}
	  \caption{\label{fig:DH:DHKE_3} Algebraic structures and types of FFs }
\end{figure}
Elliptic curves in $\mathbb{R}$ are not used in practice, because it is impossible for computers to compute decimal fractions exactly.  Instead of $\mathbb{R}$, finite fields are used (finite fields are also called Galois Fields (GF)).  These are preferred, because operations can be computed exactly using integer arithmetic. FFs only exist if they have $P^m$ elements, $GF(P^m)$. So, there is a FF with 27 elements $GF(27) = GF(3^3)$, there is a $FF$ with 256 elements $GF(256) = GF(2^8)$, etc.  In EC we are interested in Binary Fields (BFs), FFs of order $2^m$, with $m ≥ 1$.  Operations in the BF are defined in terms of an irreducible polynomial with degree $m$, this polynomial is also referred to as the reduction polynomial.  This means that the binary polynomial cannot be factored as a product of binary polynomials of degree less than $m$.  As a rule there a $2^m$ elements in $GF(2^m)$, below is an example of the elements in $GF(2^3)$.  
\newline \newline
\begin{eg} Below are the 8 elements of $GF(2^3)$:
\begin{align*}
0, \quad 1, \quad X, \quad X +1, \quad X^2, \quad X^2+1, \quad X^2 + X, \quad X^2 + X + 1
 \end{align*}
\end{eg}
\begin{rem} Given the polynomials $a,b \in  GF(P) = (0,1,2,...,P-1)$ then 
\begin{align*} 		
		a + b &\equiv c (\bmod P)\\
		a - b &\equiv d (\bmod P)\\
		a \cdot b &\equiv e (\bmod P) \quad \text{ ,the multiplicative group does not include 0}\\
		a^{-1} &\equiv b, \mathrm{~if~} a * b (\bmod P) = 1
\end{align*}
\end{rem}	
\begin{eg} Given $GF(2^4)$, then adding two polynomials is as follows:
\begin{align*}
	f(x) &= X^3 + X^2 + X + 1\\
	g(x) &= X^2  + 1\\
           f(x) + g(x) &= X^3  + X
\end{align*}
 \text{Notice that the addition of the coefficient $X^2$ and the constant 1 = 0 in GF($2^4$)}
\end{eg}

\begin{eg} Given $GF(2^8)$, then subtracting two polynomials is as follows:
\begin{align*}	
	f(x) &= X^8 +         X^6 +          X^3 + X^2 + 1\\
	g(x) &=        X^7 + X^6 + X^5 +          X^2\\
 f(x) + g(x) &= X^8 + X^7 +        X^5  + X^3  +         1
\end{align*}
\text{Notice that the binary field has only two coefficients (0,1) so subtraction and}\\
 \text{addition are the same.}
\end{eg}

\begin{eg} Given $GF(2^4)$ and the reduction polynomial $X^4 + X + 1$, then multiplying two polynomials is as follows:
\begin{align*}	
	f(x) &=  X^2 + X + 1\\
	g(x) &= X^3 + 1\\
 f(x) \cdot g(x) &= X^5 + X^4 + X^3 + X^2 + X + 1 (\bmod X^4 + X + 1)\\ 
	       &= - X^3 - X \text{ , is the remainder (see below for explanation) }
\end{align*}

\begin{defn} \label{def:Bezout's Identity}(\emph{Bezout's Identity})~~ let $x$ and $t$ be two-non-zero integers, and let $d$ be their GCD, then there exists integers $p$ and $a$ such that\\
 \hspace*{\parindent} $px + at = d$
\end{defn}
\begin{corollary}
Using Bezout's Identity we can conclude that if $p$ and $a$ are coprime then we have\\
\hspace*{\parindent} $px + at = 1$ \\
reducing $\bmod p$ yields $at = 1 \bmod p$ .  So $t$ is the multiplicative inverse of\\
 $a$ $\bmod n$.
\end{corollary}

\begin{eg} Given $GF(2^8)$ and the reduction polynomial $X^8 + X^4 + X^3 + X +1$, and $a$ = $X^6 + X^4 + X + 1$ then finding the multiplicative inverse of $a$ is as follows:  $a^{-1}$ = $b$, if $a$ $\cdot$ $b$ $(\bmod p)$ = $1$ .  To find $a^{-1}$ use the Extended Euclidian Algorithm.
\\
	$p =  X^8 + X^4 + X^3 + X +1$\\ 
	$a = X^6 + X^4 + X + 1$\\
\\Using the quotients and remainders found below, we can find the multiplicative inverse of $a$ using the following steps \\(new $t$ = old $t - $quotient $\cdot$ $t$):
\begin{enumerate}
\item $t = 0$
\item new $ t = 1$ 
\item new $t = 0 - 1\cdot(x^2 + 1)$
\item  new $t = 1 - (x^4 + x^2)\cdot(x^2 + 1)$
\item new $t = (x^2 + 1) - (x+1)\cdot(x^6 + x^2 + 1)$
\item Stop here and simplify, since the subsequent remainder is 0.
\item new $t = (x^2 + 1) - (x+1)\cdot(x^6 + x^2 + 1)$ = $x^7 + x^6 + x^3 + x$
\end{enumerate}
Thus, $a^{-1}$ = $x^7 + x^6 + x^3 + x$\\

Now back to Elliptic Curves, the  ECs that we are interested in have a certain geometrical shape E: $y^2 = x^3 + ax + b (\bmod P)$.  See Figure~\ref{fig:DH:DHKE_5} below for a geometrical representation.  Furthermore, in order to prevent points of singularities in the curve the EC equation must also satasify the following: $4a^3 + 27b^2 \neq 0$
\begin{figure}[H]
	   \center{\includegraphics[width=2.5in]
	         {images/DHKE_5.png}}
	  \caption{\label{fig:DH:DHKE_5}   E: $ y^2$ = $x^3+ax+b (\bmod P)$ }
\end{figure}
\subsection{EC Math} A group operation, within the parameters of the EC, sometimes referred to as addition is given by two points on the EC, $P_1$, $P_2$ $\in$ E then $P_1 + P_2$ = $P_3$

Geometrically if the two points are different then $P_1 + P_2$ is given by drawing a line from point $P_1$ to point $P_2$ and continue the line until it intersects the elliptic curve then reflecting that point about the $x$-axis.  See figure Figure~\ref{fig:DH:DHKE_6} below for a geometrical representation.
\begin{figure}[H]

	         {images/DHKE_6.png}}
	  \caption{\label{fig:DH:DHKE_6} }
\end{figure}
Geometrically if the two points are the same then a tangent line to the point is drawn and the resulting operation is then reflected about the x-axis.  This is often referred to as point doubling. See Figure~\ref{fig:DH:DHKE_7} below for a geometrical representation.
\begin{figure}[H]

\end{figure}
**Note, $P_3$ is the Public Key, while the number of hops, $d$, to get to $P_3$ is the Private Key.  In addition, the points on the EC form an abelian group.**

\begin{corollary}
Given E: $y^2 = x^3 + ax + b (\bmod P)$, $P_1 = (x_1, y_1)$, $P_2 = (x_2, y_2)$, and $P_3 = (x_3, y_3)$. Find $P_3$, where $ P_3 =  P_1 + P_2$
\end{corollary}
\begin{enumerate}[(1)] 
	\item The slope $m =(y_2 - y_1)$ $\cdot$ $(x_2- x_1)^{-1}$ $\bmod P$, for $P_1$ $\neq$ $P_2$ \\
		\text{ \qquad \: \:} or $m =(3x^2_1 + a)$ $\cdot$ $(2y_1)^{-1}$ $\bmod P$, for $P_1 = P_2$ 
	\item $x_3 = m^2 - x_1 - x_2 (\bmod P)$ \\
		$y_3 = m(x_1 - x_3) - y_1 (\bmod P)$
	\item For $P^{-1}, m = \infty$ and $P = (x, -y)$ \\
		and $\infty + P = P$, for all $P$
\end {enumerate} 

\begin{eg} Given E: $y^2 = x^3 + 2x + 2 (\bmod17)$, $P_1 = (5,1)$, $P_2 = (5,1)$, and $P_3 = (x_3, y_3)$
	Find $P_3$, where $P_3 = P_1 + P_2$
		\begin{align*}
		\textrm{(1) The slope~} m
		 &= ( (3 \cdot 5^2) + 2) \cdot (2 \cdot 1)^{-1} \bmod 17\\
	          &= (77) \cdot (2)^{-1} \bmod 17\\
                     &\equiv (9) \cdot (9) \bmod 17\\
                     &\equiv 81 \bmod 17\\
                    &\equiv 13
		\end{align*}
		\begin{align*}
		\textrm{(2)~}x_3
		 &= ( (13^2 - 5 - 5  (\bmod 17)) \text{\qquad \qquad \qquad \quad \: \: }\\
	          &= 159(\bmod 17)\\
                     &\equiv 6
		\end{align*}
			\begin{align*}
		\textrm{(3)~}y_3
		 &= ( (13(5 - 6) - 1(\bmod 17)) \text{\qquad \qquad \qquad \quad }\\
	          &= -14(\bmod 17)\\
                     &\equiv 3
		\end{align*}
Thus, $P_3 = (6,3) = 2P$
\end{eg}
\begin {exer}
Using Example 20, find the following: $3P, 4P, 5P, ..., 20P.$  Recall: $3P = 2P + P;  4P = 3P +P;$ etc.  What do you notice about $18P,  19P,$ and $20P?$

Using Example 20 and Exercise 21, let us reconstruct the Diffie Hellman Key Exchange, but this time we'll use the strength of ECC.  Follow along with Figure~\ref{fig:DH:DHKE_8} below.
