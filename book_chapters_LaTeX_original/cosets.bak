Groups, like onions and ogres, also have layers. As we've seen, many groups have subgroups inside them. These subgroups can be used to define ``layers'' which are called \emph{cosets}. And in some cases, the ``layers'' (cosets) themselves form groups, which are called \emph{factor groups}. 

Our examination of cosets will give us deep insight into the nature and structure of groups. We will be leaning heavily on the material from Chapter~\ref{modular}  (which will furnish us with motivating examples), Chapter~\ref{EquivalenceRelationsChap} (which will aid us in our characterization of cosets), and of course Chapter~\ref{groups}.  In the course of reading this chapter, you may want to review these chapters.   So, here we go!\footnote{Thanks to Tom Judson for material used in this chapter.}

\section{Definition of cosets}\label{cosets:def}

The concept of ``coset'' brings together two ideas that we've seen before: subgroups and equivalence classes. We'll see how cosets arise from this mix by using a familiar example.

\begin{example}{ModArith}\emph{(Modular addition d\'ej\`a vu All Over Again)}  

Back in Chapter~\ref{modular} we defined modular equivalence (Definition~\ref{definition:modular:equivalence}), and in Proposition~\ref{proposition:modular:equivalence_alt} we gave an alternative characterization:
\medskip

$a \equiv b \pmod{m}$ iff $a - b = k \cdot m$, where $k$ is an integer (that is, $k \in  {\mathbb Z}$). 
\medskip

\begin{exercise}{}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item
Give 4 integers $a$ that satisfy the equation: $a \equiv 0 \pmod{3}$.
\item
Give 4 integers $a$ that satisfy the equation: $a \equiv 2 \pmod{3}$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

\noindent
In Section~\ref{EquivalenceRelationsModArithSect} in the Equivalence Relations chapter, we saw that modular equivalence was indeed an \emph{equivalence relation}, and  gave rise to \emph{equivalence classes}:
\medskip

$[0]_3  = \{\mbox{All integers equivalent to 0 mod 3}\} = \{ \ldots -9, -6, -3, 0, 3, 6, 9 \ldots \}.$

$[1]_3  = \{\mbox{All integers equivalent to 1 mod 3}\} = \{ \ldots -8, -5, -2, 1, 4, 7, 10 \ldots \}.$

$[2]_3  = \{\mbox{All integers equivalent to 2 mod 3}\} = \{ \ldots -7, -4, -1, 2, 5, 8, 11 \ldots \}.$
\medskip

\noindent
Then in the Groups chapter we introduced an alternative notation for $[0]_3$, namely $3{\mathbb Z}$. Since every element of  $[1]_3$ is 1~+~an element of $3{\mathbb Z}$ (and similarly for $[2]_3$)  it makes sense to introduce the notation:
\medskip

$[1]_3  = 1 + 3{\mathbb Z}.$

$[2]_3  = 2 + 3{\mathbb Z}.$
\medskip

\noindent
Notice the pattern here. Recall that $3{\mathbb Z}$ is a \emph{subgroup} of ${\mathbb Z}$. In order to ``create" the equivalence class $1 + 3{\mathbb Z}$, we added a specific group element (namely, 1) to \emph{every} element of the subgroup $3{\mathbb Z}$. The same holds true for $2 +  3{\mathbb Z}$ -- in both cases the notation follows the pattern: 
\medskip

(selected group element) (group operation) (Subgroup). 
\medskip

\noindent
An alternative notation that also makes sense is:
\medskip

$[1]_3  =  3{\mathbb Z} + 1$

$[2]_3  = 3{\mathbb Z} + 2,$
\medskip

\noindent
which follows the pattern:
\medskip

(Subgroup) (group operation) (selected group element).
\end{example}

\begin{exercise}{}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item
Write the 5 equivalence classes (subsets) of ${\mathbb Z}$)  which make up ${\mathbb Z}_5$ in using our new notation.
\item
Write all elements of ${\mathbb Z}_7$ using our new notation.
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

The same pattern that we saw in the preceding example can actually be generalized to any group possessing a subgroup:

\begin{defn}\label{def_coset}
Let $G$ be a group and $H$ a subgroup of $G$.  The \term{left  coset}\index{Coset!left} of $H$ with \term{ representative}\index{Coset!representative} $g \in G$ is defined as the following set: 
\[
gH = \{ gh : h \in H \}.
\]
\term{Right cosets}\index{Coset!right} are defined similarly by
\[
Hg = \{ hg : h \in H \}.
\]
(Note that in the preceding equations, ``$gh$'' denotes $g \compose h$ where $\compose$ is the group operation. This is similar to our writing $xy$ to denote $x \cdot y$ in conventional algebra).
\end{defn}

Definition \ref{def_coset} looks a little different from Example~\ref{example:cosets:ModArith}, e.g. we have $gH$ instead of  $3 + {\mathbb Z}$.  But in fact the pattern is the same:  (group element) (group operation) (Subgroup).  If the group operation is +, we will typically write left cosets as $g + H$ and right cosets as $H + g$. For all other group operations, we'll use the more compact notation $gH$ and $Hg$.

Now Definition \ref{def_coset} distinguishes between a \emph{left} and \emph{right} cosets.   In Example~\ref{example:cosets:ModArith}, $1 + 3{\mathbb Z}$ (left coset) and $ 3{\mathbb Z} + 1$ (right coset) were in fact the same set; and this held for the other two cosets: the left and right cosets were equal.  But is this always the case?  Interestingly not:

\begin{example}{S3_Cosets}
\begin{itemize}
\item
Let $H$ be the subgroup of $S_3$ defined by the permutations $\{(1), (123), (132) \}$.  (Here we are using $(1)$ to denote the identity permutation ${\var id}$.) The left cosets of $H$ are 
\begin{gather*}
(1)H = (1 2 3)H =  (132)H = \{(1), (1 23), (132) \} \\
(1 2)H = (1 3)H = (2 3)H =  \{ (1 2), (1 3), (2 3)  \}.
\end{gather*}
and the right cosets of $H$ are
\begin{gather*}
H(1) = H(1 2 3) =  H(132) = \{(1), (1 23), (132) \} \\
H(1 2) = H(1 3) = H(2 3) =  \{ (1 2), (1 3), (2 3)  \}.
\end{gather*}
So in this case again the left cosets and right cosets are the same.

\item
\emph{But}, let $K$ be the subgroup of $S_3$ defined by the permutations $\{(1), (1 2)\}$.  Then the left cosets of $K$ are
\begin{gather*}
(1)K = (1 2)K = \{(1), (1 2)\} \\
(1 3)K = (1 2 3)K = \{(1 3), (1 2 3)\} \\
(2 3)K = (1 3 2)K = \{(2 3), (1 3 2)\};
\end{gather*}
and the right cosets of $K$ are
\begin{gather*}
K(1) = K(1 2) = \{(1), (1 2)\} \\
K(1 3) = K(1 3 2) = \{(1 3), (1 3 2)\} \\
K(2 3) = K(1 2 3) = \{(2 3), (1 2 3)\}.
\end{gather*}
The left and right cosets are \emph{not} the same. 
\end{itemize}
\end{example}

Unequal left and right cosets are actually very common.  So let's get some practice determining left and right cosets:

\begin{exercise}{Z6_cosets}
Let $H$ be the subgroup of ${\mathbb Z}_6 = \{0,1,2,3,4,5\}$ consisting of the elements 0 and 3.
(We are using our simplified notation here: `0' represents $\overline{0}$, etc.)  The left cosets are 
\begin{gather*}
0 + H = 3 + H = \{ 0, 3 \} \\
1 + H = 4 + H = \{ 1, 4 \} \\
2 + H = 5 + H = \{ 2, 5 \}.
\end{gather*}
What are the right cosets? Are the left and right cosets equal?
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}{left_right_cosets}
List the left and right cosets of the subgroups in each of the following.  Tell whether the left and right cosets are equal.

\noindent
(Recall that $A_n$ (the alternating group) is the set of even permutations, on $n$ objects; $D_4$ is the group of symmetries of a square; and ${\mathbb T}$ is the group of complex numbers with modulus 1, under the operation of multiplication.)

\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]

\item 
$\langle 8 \rangle$ in ${\mathbb Z}_{24}$

\item
$\langle 3 \rangle$ in $U(8)$

\item
$4{\mathbb Z}$ in ${\mathbb Z}$

\item
$H = \{ (1), (123), (132) \}$ in $S_4$

\item
$K =\{ (1), (12), (13), (14) \}$ in $S_4$

\item
$A_4$ in $S_4$

\item
$A_n$ in $S_n$

\item
$D_4$ in $S_4$

\item
${\mathbb T}$ in ${\mathbb C}^\ast$ 






\end{enumerate}
\end{multicols}
\end{exercise} 

\begin{rem}
From now on, if the left and right cosets coincide, or if it is clear from the context to which type of coset that we are referring, we will use the word {\em coset} without specifying left or right.
\end{rem}

From the exercises and examples we have seen so far, you might have seen a pattern; you might have started thinking, ``hmmmm, I wonder if the group being abelian causes the left and right cosets to be equal?"  This makes sense, because
 abelian means you get the same result whether you compose on the left or on the right.
%no matter the order you operate; i.e. given an abelian group $G$ and elements $a,b \in G$, $ab=ba$.  So whether you compose $a$ on the left side of a subgroup or the right side of a subgroup, the result of the compositions will be the same elements, the same set.  
So let's prove it:
  
% For example, the following exercise shows that we can talk about cosets in an abelian group without worrying about left or right.

\begin{exercise}{abelian_cosets}
Show that if $G$ is an \emph{abelian} group and $H$ is a subgroup of $G$, then any left coset $gH$ is equal to the right coset $Hg$.  
\hyperref[sec:cosets:hints]{(*Hint*)}
\end{exercise}

Are abelian groups the only groups in which left cosets are equal to right cosets? The answer is No (see the first case in Example~\ref{example:cosets:S3_Cosets}. So we still haven't answered the question of what is the most general situation in which left cosets and right cosets are equal. We'll take this issue up again in Section~\ref{cosets:normal}.


%This last exercise also brings up a good thought.  We've been proving left and right cosets equal in a very tedious manner dependent on which group we were looking at and what subgroup we chose.  But in the last exercise we proved left and right cosets equal in a much more general context (abelian groups) and fashion, using some group and set theory definitons and methodology we've learned previously.  And even this was still a tad tedious because we had to show one set was a subset of the second and vice versa.  So could we extend this farther?  Can we find a way to prove \emph{any} two cosets equal, no matter what group or subgroups we're looking at?  We can.  In fact, the following proposition gives us not just one, but a number of different ways of showing that two cosets are equal:
  



%In our previous example, we characterized cosets in the case where the group $G = {\mathbb Z}$ and the subgroup $H = %3{\mathbb Z}$, which are obviously infinite groups.  Of particular interest however is the case where the groups $G$ and $H$ are %\emph{finite}:

\section{Cosets and partitions of groups}\label{sec:CosetsPartitions}

In Example~\ref{example:cosets:ModArith}, the cosets that we described were equivalence classes. We saw in Chapter~\ref{EquivalenceRelationsChap} that equivalence classes form a \emph{partition} which divides up the containing set into disjoint subsets.
This is actually a general fact that is true for all cosets, and we will prove this below. In the proof, we will need the following proposition, which shows there are several different ways of characterizing when two cosets are equal.  

\begin{thm}\label{cosets_theorem_1}
Let $H$ be a subgroup of a group $G$ and suppose that $g_1, g_2 \in G$.  The following conditions are equivalent.  
\begin{enumerate}
 
\item
$g_1 H = g_2 H$; 

\item
$g_1^{-1} g_2 \in H$.

\item
$g_2 \in g_1 H$; 

\item
$g_2 H \subset g_1 H$; \qquad (\emph{Note:} ``$\subset$'' means equality is also possible)

\item
$H g_1^{-1}  = H g_2^{-1}$; 


 \end{enumerate}
\end{thm}
The proof of this Proposition is laid out in the Exercise~\ref{exercise:cosets:CosetEquiv} below, and you are asked to fill in the details. Parts (a)-(f) of the exercise establish the following steps:
\[ (1) \underset{(a)}\implies (2) \underset{(b)}\implies (3) \underset{(c)}\implies (4) \underset{(d)}\implies (1) \qquad \text{and} \qquad (2) \underset{(e,f)}\Leftrightarrow (5). \]


\begin{exercise}{CosetEquiv}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item
Show that condition (1) implies condition (2).  
\hyperref[sec:cosets:hints]{(*Hint*)}

\item
Show that condition (2) implies condition (3).
\hyperref[sec:cosets:hints]{(*Hint*)}


\item
Show that condition (3) implies condition (4).
\hyperref[sec:cosets:hints]{(*Hint*)}

\item
Show that condition (4) implies condition (1).
\hyperref[sec:cosets:hints]{(*Hint*)}

\item
Show that condition (2) implies condition (5).
\hyperref[sec:cosets:hints]{(*Hint*)}

\item
Show that condition (5) implies condition (2).
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}{}
Proposition~\ref{cosets_theorem_1} deals with \emph{left} cosets. A parallel proposition holds for right cosets. List the five equivalent conditions for \emph{right} cosets that correspond to the five conditions given in Proposition~\ref{cosets_theorem_1}.
\end{exercise}

Now we're ready to prove that the cosets of a subgroup always form a partition of the group that contains it:

\begin{thm}\label{cosets_theorem_2}
Let $H$ be a subgroup of a group $G$.  Then the left cosets of $H$ in $G$ partition $G$.  That is, the group $G$ is the disjoint union of the left cosets of $H$ in $G$. 
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
Let $g_1 H$ and $g_2 H$ be two cosets of $H$ in $G$.  We must show that either $g_1 H \cap g_2 H = \emptyset$ or $g_1 H = g_2 H$.  Suppose that $g_1 H \cap g_2 H \neq \emptyset$ and $a \in g_1 H \cap g_2 H$.  Then by the definition of a left coset, $a = g_1 h_1 = g_2 h_2$ for some elements $h_1$ and $h_2$ in $H$.  Hence, $g_1 = g_2 h_2 h_1^{-1}$ or $g_1 \in g_2 H$.  By Proposition~\ref{cosets_theorem_1}, $g_1 H = g_2 H$. 
\end{proof}

\begin{rem}\label{right_is_left}
Right cosets also partition $G$. The partition may not be the same as the partition using the left cosets, since the left and right cosets aren't necessarily equal, 
The proof of this fact is exactly the same as the proof for left cosets except that all group multiplications are done on the right side of $H$.
\end{rem} 

Let's consider now the question of how many cosets there are for a particular subgroup within a given group. First, we define some convenient notation:

\begin{defn}\label{cosets_index}
Let $G$ be a group and $H$ be a subgroup of $G$.  Define the \term{index}\index{Index of a subgroup}\index{Subgroup!index of} of $H$ in $G$ to be the number of left cosets of $H$ in $G$.  We will denote the index by~$[G:H]$\label{indexofasubgroup}.
\end{defn}  

\begin{example}{Z6_index}
Let $G= {\mathbb Z}_6$ and $H = \{ 0, 3 \}$. Then looking back at Exercise~\ref{exercise:cosets:Z6_cosets}, we see that $[G:H] = 3$.
\end{example}

\begin{exercise}{Z6_right_index}
Based on your work in  Exercise~\ref{exercise:cosets:Z6_cosets}, how many right cosets of  $H = \{ 0, 3 \}$ were there in ${\mathbb Z}_6$?
\end{exercise}

\begin{example}{S3_index}
Suppose that $G= S_3$, $H = \{ (1),(123), (132) \}$, and $K= \{ (1), (12) \}$.  Then looking back at Example~\ref{example:cosets:S3_Cosets}, we can see that $[G:H] = 2$ and $[G:K] = 3$. 
\end{example}

\begin{exercise}{S3_right_index}
How many right cosets of  $H = \{ (1),(123), (132) \}$ in $S_3$ were there?  How about right cosets of  $K= \{ (1), (12) \}$ in $S_3$?
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}{}
Using your work from Exercise~\ref{exercise:cosets:left_right_cosets}, find:

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item
$[ {\mathbb Z}_{24}: \langle 8 \rangle ]$ and the number of right cosets of $\langle 8 \rangle$ in ${\mathbb Z}_{24}$.

\item
$[ U(8) : \langle 3 \rangle ]$ and the number of right cosets of $\langle 3 \rangle$ in $U(8)$.

\item
$[{\mathbb Z} : 4{\mathbb Z} ]$ and the number of right cosets of $4{\mathbb Z}$ in ${\mathbb Z}$.

\item
$[  S_4 : \{ (1), (123), (132) \}  ]$ and the number of the right cosets of $\{ (1), (123), (132) \}$ in $S_4$.

\item
$[ S_4 : \{ (1), (12), (13), (14) \} ]$ and the number of right cosets of $\{ (1), (12), (13), (14) \}$ in $S_4$.

\item
$[ S_4 : A_4 ]$ and the number of right cosets of $A_4$ in $S_4$.

\item
$[ S_n : A_n ]$ and the number of right cosets of $A_n$ in $S_n$.

\item
$[S_4 : D_4  ]$ and the number of right cosets of $D_4$ in $S_4$.

\item
$[ {\mathbb C}^\ast : {\mathbb T} ]$ and the number or right cosets of ${\mathbb T}$ in ${\mathbb C}^\ast$.

\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

As the last several examples and exericses seem to suggest, though the the left and right cosets of a subgroup aren't necessarily equal, it seems the \emph{number} of them is the same.  Indeed we can prove this:

\begin{thm}\label{cosets_theorem_3}
Let $H$ be a subgroup of a group $G$.  The number of left cosets of $H$ in $G$ is the same as the number of right cosets of $H$ in $G$.  
\end{thm}

 
\begin{proof}
Let $L$ and  $R$ denote the set of left and right cosets of $H$ in $G$, respectively.  If we can define a bijection $\phi :  L \rightarrow R$, then the proposition will be proved.  If $gH \in L$, let $\phi( gH ) = Hg^{-1}$.  By Proposition~\ref{cosets_theorem_1}, the map $\phi$ is well-defined; that is, if $g_1 H = g_2 H$, then $H g_1^{-1} = H g_2^{-1}$.  To show that $\phi$ is one-to-one, suppose that 
\[
H g_1^{-1} = \phi( g_1 H ) = \phi( g_2 H ) = H g_2^{-1}.
\]
Again by Proposition~\ref{cosets_theorem_1}, $g_1 H = g_2 H$.  The map $\phi$ is onto since $\phi(g^{-1} H ) = H g$. 
\hspace*{1in}
\end{proof}
 


\begin{exercise}{SL2_cosets}
Describe the left and right cosets of $SL_2( {\mathbb R} )$ in $GL_2( {\mathbb R})$.   What is the index of $SL_2( {\mathbb R} )$ in $GL_2( {\mathbb R})$? Are the left and right cosets equal?
\end{exercise}

Are the left and right cosets equal? \footnote{$Q_8$ is the \emph{quaternion group}, mentioned in Exercise~\ref{quaternion_ex} of Chapter~\ref{groups}. You will need the Cayley table for  the quaternions to figure out the left and right cosets, which can be found on Wikipedia or another web source.}

\section{Lagrange's theorem, and some consequences}\label{sec:LagThm}

\subsection{Lagrange's theorem}
At the beginning of the chapter, we compared cosets to layers of an onion.  Indeed, as we saw in the last section, this is a good analogy because the cosets of a subgroup partion the group.  However, an even better analogy is to slices of a loaf of sandwich bread--because as we'll see in this section, every coset of a particular subgroup within a given group has exactly the same size. 

What may we conclude from this? Let us push our analogy with sandwich bread a little farther. Suppose the bread has raisins in it, and each slice has exactly the same number of raisins. Then the number of raisins in the loaf must be equal to the sum of all raisins in all the slices, that is:


$|$raisins in loaf$|$ = $|$raisins in each slice$| \cdot |$slices$|$,

\noindent
where as usual the $| \cdots |$ notation  signifies ``size'' or ``number of''.
Applying this same reasoning to groups and their subgroups leads to a very general result called \emph{Lagrange's theorem},  which will enable us to prove some surprising  properties of subgroups, their elements, and even some results in number theory.  So let's get started.  

\begin{rem}\label{left_is_right}
In the following discussion, for specificity's sake we will refer to left cosets. However, just lke we saw in the last section (Remark~\ref{right_is_left}), everything we say about left cosets is also true for right cosets. Indeed, to prove the cases for the right cosets, you simply need to take the left coset proofs given below and operate on the right instead of the left.
\end{rem}

As we mentioned in our raisin bread analogy, to prove  Lagrange's theorem, we need to prove that every left coset of a subgroup has the exactly the same size.  Once we have that though, Lagrange's Theorem comes immediately from it:

\begin{thm}\label{cosets_theorem_4}
Let $H$ be a subgroup of $G$ with $g \in G$ and define a map $\phi:H \rightarrow gH$ by $\phi(h) = gh$.  The map $\phi$ is a bijection; hence, the number of elements in $H$ is the same as the number of elements in $gH$. 
\end{thm}
 
\begin{proof}
We first show that the map $\phi$ is one-to-one.  Suppose that $\phi(h_1)  = \phi(h_2)$ for elements $h_1, h_2 \in H$.  We must show that $h_1 =  h_2$, but $\phi(h_1) = gh_1$ and $\phi(h_2) = gh_2$.  So $gh_1 = gh_2$,  and by left cancellation $h_1= h_2$.  To show that $\phi$ is onto is easy.  By definition every element of $gH$ is of the form $gh$ for some $h \in H$ and $\phi(h) = gh$. 
\end{proof}

\begin{thm}[Lagrange's Theorem]\index{Lagrange's Theorem}\label{LagrangeTheorem}
Let $G$ be a finite group and let $H$ be a subgroup of $G$.  Then $|G|/|H| = [G : H]$ is the number of distinct left cosets of $H$ in $G$.  In particular, the number of elements in $H$ must divide the number of elements in $G$. 
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
The group $G$ is partitioned into $[G : H]$ distinct left cosets.  Each left coset has $|H|$ elements; therefore, $|G| = [G : H] |H|$.
\end{proof}

And there we have it. The number of elements in a subgroup \emph{must} divide evenly into the number of elements in the group; you can't have just any number of elements in a subgroup. This is a very powerful tool to give insight into the structure of groups.

\begin{example}{}
Let $G$ be a group with $|G|=25$.  Then since $2$ doesn't divide 25 evenly, Lagrange's Theorem implies that $G$ can't possibly have a subgroup with 2 elements.
\end{example}
%it couldn't have a subgroup with $2$ elements in it.  Because if that subgroup existed, it would partition the $25$-element group into some whole number of $2$-element cosets; but that's impossible, because $2$ times a whole number can never make $25$.  This is what Lagrange's Theorem says in a very compact, elegant manner.  Let's practice a couple preliminary exercises with groups using Lagrange's Theorem:

\begin{exercise}{}
Suppose that $G$ is a finite group with an element $g$ of order 5 and an element $h$ of order 7. Why must $|G| \geq 35$?
\end{exercise} 

\begin{exercise}{}
Suppose that $G$ is a finite group with 60 elements.  What are the possible orders for subgroups of $G$?
\end{exercise}


We can take the result in Lagrange's theorem a step farther by considering  subgroups of subgroups. 

\begin{thm}\label{cosets_theorem_8}
Let $H$ and $K$ be subgroups of a finite group $G$ such that $G \supset H \supset K$.  Then 
\[
[G:K] = [G:H][H:K].
\]
\end{thm}
 
\begin{proof}
Observe that
\[
[G:K] = \frac{|G|}{|K|} = \frac{|G|}{|H|} \cdot
\frac{|H|}{|K|} = [G:H][H:K].
\]
\end{proof}

Joseph-Louis Lagrange\index{Lagrange, Joseph-Louis} (1736--1813), born in Turin, Italy, was of French and Italian descent.  His talent for mathematics became apparent at an early age.  Leonhard Euler\index{Euler, Leonhard} recognized Lagrange's abilities when Lagrange, who was only 19, communicated to Euler some work that he had done in the calculus of variations.  That year he was also named a professor at the Royal Artillery School in Turin.  At the age of 23 he joined the Berlin Academy. Frederick the Great had written to Lagrange proclaiming that the ``greatest king in Europe'' should have the ``greatest mathematician in Europe'' at his court.  For 20 years Lagrange held the position vacated by his mentor, Euler.  His works include contributions to number theory, group theory, physics and mechanics, the calculus of variations, the theory of equations, and differential equations.  Along with Laplace and Lavoisier, Lagrange was one of the people responsible for designing the metric system.  During his life Lagrange profoundly influenced the development of mathematics, leaving much to the next generation of mathematicians in the form of examples and new problems to be solved.

\subsection{Orders of elements, Euler's theorem, Fermat's little theorem, and prime order}\label{sec:Fermat}

Now let's really put Lagrange's theorem to work. Note that Lagrange's theorem is an extremely general result--it applies to \emph{any} subgroup of \emph{any} group. So let's consider one particular type of subgroup, namely the cyclic subgroups $\langle g \rangle$ generated by the elements $g$ of a given group $G$ (see Proposition~\ref{OrbitIsSubgroup} in Section~\ref{CyclicSubgrups} of the Groups chapter  for the definition of $\langle g \rangle$, and the proof that it is indeed a group).

\begin{thm}\label{cosets_theorem_6}
Suppose that $G$ is a finite group and $g \in G$.  Then the order of $g$ must divide the number of elements in $G$. 
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
The order of a group element $g$, which is denoted as $|g|$, is defined in Definition~\ref{DefOrder} in Section~\ref{CyclicSubgrups} of the Groups chapter. We indicated in Exercise~\ref{exercise:groups:OrderEltCyclic} in that same section that $|g|$ is equal to $|\langle g \rangle|$, which is  the order of the cylic subgroup generated by $g$. It follows immediately from Lagrange's theorem that $|g|$ must divide $|G|$.
\end{proof}

To show the power of this result, we'll apply it to  the group of units $U(n)$ which was introduced in 
Section~\ref{subsec:GroupOfUnits} of the Groups chapter.

But before we do this, let's do some exploration. Recall that the elements of $U(n)$ are the positive integers that are less than $n$ and relatively prime to $n$ (we showed in Exercise~\ref{exercise:groups:U(n)_abgroup} of Section~\ref{subsec:GroupOfUnits} that these elements actually form a group. There is a special notation for the number of elements in $U(n)$:

\begin{defn}
For $n>1$, define $\phi(n)$ as the number of natural numbers that are less than $n$ and relatively prime to $n$. Alternatively, we can say that  $\phi(n)$ is the number of natural numbers $m$ where  $m < n$ and $\gcd(m,n) = 1$. In order to make $\phi$ a function on the natural numbers, we also define $\phi(1)=1$. 
The function $\phi$ is called the \term{Euler $\phi$-function}\index{Euler $\phi$-function}.
\end{defn}


\begin{exercise}{phivals}
Evaluate the following:
\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item
$\phi(12)$
\item
$\phi(16)$
\item
$\phi(20)$
\item
$\phi(23)$
\item
$\phi(51)$
\item
$\phi(p)$, where $p$ is prime.
\item\label{p2}
$\phi(p^2)$, where $p$ is prime. \item
$\phi(p^n)$, where $p$ is prime and $n \in {\mathbb N}$.
\item
$\phi(pq)$, where $p$ and $q$ are primes and $p \neq q$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{multicols}
\noindent
\hyperref[sec:cosets:hints]{(*Hint*)}
\end{exercise}


If we now apply Lagrange's theorem to $U(n)$, we obtain an important result in number theory which was first proved by Leonhard Euler in 1763. 

\begin{thm} (\emph{Euler's theorem}) \label{cosets:Eulers_theorem}\index{Euler's theorem}
Let $a$ and $n$ be integers such that $n>0$ and $\gcd(a, n) = 1$.  Then $a^{\phi(n)} \equiv 1 \pmod{n}$.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
First, let $r$ be the remainder when $a$ is divided by $n$. We may consider $r$ as an element of $U(n)$.

As noted above, the order of $U(n)$ is $\phi(n)$.  Lagrange's theorem then tells us that $|r|$ divides $\phi(n)$, so we can write: $\phi(n) = k|r|$, where $k \in {\mathbb N}$.   Consequently, considering $r$ as an element of $U(n)$, we have $r^{\phi(n)} = r^{k|r|} = (r^{|r|})^k = (1)^k=1$ (note that the multiplication that is being used here is \emph{modular} multiplication, not regular multiplication). 

Finally, we may use  the fact that $a \equiv r \pmod{n}$ and apply Exercise~\ref{exercise:modular:ModPower} in Section~\ref{ArithWithRems} (Modular Arithmetic chapter) to conclude that $a^{\phi(n)} \equiv 1 \pmod{n}$.

\hspace*{0.5in}
\end{proof}

\begin{exercise}{}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item
Verify Euler's theorem for $n = 15$ and $a = 4$.
\item
Verify Euler's theorem for $n = 22$ and $a = 3$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}{}
Evaluate the following, using the results of Exercise~\ref{exercise:cosets:phivals}
\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item
$\mod(5^{200},12)$
\item
$\mod(13^{48},16)$
\item
$\mod(9^{200},20)$
\item

\item
$\mod(10^{33},51)$
\item
$\mod \left( \left( \frac{p+1}{2} \right)^p,p\right)$, where $p$ is prime.
\item
$\mod ( (p+1)^{p^2},p^2)$, where $p$ is prime.
\end{enumerate}
\end{multicols}
\end{exercise}

In the following exercise you will prove \emph{Fermat's little theorem}\index{Fermat!little theorem}, which may be thought of as a special case of Euler's theorem:

\begin{exercise}{FermatLittle}
Suppose that $p$ is a prime number, and $a$ is a natural number which is relatively prime to $p$. Show that  $a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \bmod{p}$.
\end{exercise}

We can also apply Proposition~\ref{cosets_theorem_6} to groups of prime order, as in the following exercise.

\begin{exercise}{}
Let $G$ be a group such that $|G| = p$, where $p$ is a prime number.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item
Let $a$ be an element of $G \setminus \{e\}$.  What does Proposition~\ref{cosets_theorem_6} tell us about $|a|$?
\item
Prove that $G$ is cyclic.
\item
Describe the set of generators of $G$  (recall that $g \in G$ is a generator of $G$ if $\langle g \rangle = G$.)
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

The results of the preceding exercise can be summarized as follows:

\begin{thm}\label{cosets_theorem_7}
Let $|G| = p$ with $p$ a prime number.  Then $G$ is cyclic and any $g \in G$ such that $g \neq e$ is a generator. 
\end{thm}
Later we will use this proposition to show that all groups of  prime order $p$  are the ``same'' in some sense (see Section~\ref{ClassificationOfCylic} of the Isomorphisms chapter).

Finally, we can use Lagrange's theorem to show that groups of prime order have a very simple structure:
 
\begin{exercise}{prime_simple}
Let $G$ be a group of prime order. Use Lagrange's Theorem to show that the only proper subgroup of $G$ is the trivial subgroup $\{e\}$.
\end{exercise}

Exercise~\ref{exercise:cosets:prime_simple} shows that groups of prime order (such as ${\mathbb Z}_p$)  are ``simple'' in the sense that they don't contain any nontrivial subgroups. In Section~\ref{normal:section:simplealternating} we will talk more about ``simple'' groups.


%%% CPT the following proof is incorrect, because it confuses conjugacy in S_n with conjugacy in A_n
%\subsection{Disproving the converse of Lagrange's theorem: conjugate group elements}
%
%According to Lagrange's Theorem, any subgroup of a group of order 12 must  have order 1, 2, 3, 4, or  6.  But is the converse of Lagrange's theorem also true? For example, for any group of order 12, must there exist subgroups of each of these orders?
%
%In order to disprove the converse of Lagrange's theorem, all we need to do is find one example where it fails. The example we'll give  is $A_4$, the group of even permutations on 4 symbols. $|A_4|=12$, and we'll show that $A_4$ has no subgroup of order 6.
%
%In order to show this, we need to introduce the concept of \emph{conjugate elements}, which will be useful later:
%
%\begin{defn}
%Let $G$ be a group, and let $a,b \in G$.  Then $a$ and $b$ are said to be \term{conjugate elements} if and only if there exists a $c \in G$ such that $b = c \circ a \circ c^{-1}$.
%\index{Conjugate!group elements}\index{Permutation!conjugate}
%\end{defn}
%
%It turns out that in permutation groups, conjugation is closely tied up with cycle structure, as shown in the following proposition.
%
%\begin{thm}\label{cosets:cycle_length_theorem}
%Two cycles $\tau$ and $\mu$ in $S_n$ have the same length if and only if they are conjugate in $S_n$: that is, there exists a $\sigma \in S_n$ such that $\mu = \sigma \tau \sigma^{-1}$.  
%\end{thm}
% 
%\begin{proof}
%Suppose that
%$\tau  = (a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_k )$ and $\mu   = (b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_k )$.
%Define $\sigma$ to be the permutation
%\begin{align*}
%\sigma( a_1 )  = b_1,~~~\sigma( a_2 )  = b_2,~~\ldots,~~ \sigma( a_k )  = b_k.
%\end{align*}
%Then $\mu = \sigma \tau \sigma^{-1}$ (we'll show this in detail in Exercise~\ref{exercise:cosets:conjugate} below).
%
%Conversely, suppose that $\tau = (a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_k )$ is a $k$-cycle and $\sigma \in S_n$. If $\sigma( a_i ) = b$ and $\sigma( a_{(i+1) \bmod k)} ) = b'$, then $\mu( b) = b'$.  Hence, 
%\[
%\mu = ( \sigma(a_1), \sigma(a_2), \ldots, \sigma(a_k) ).
%\]
%Since $\sigma$ is one-to-one and onto, $\mu$ is a cycle of the same length as $\tau$. 
%\end{proof}
%
%\begin{exercise}{conjugate}
%Given $\tau, \mu$, and $\sigma$ as Proposition~\ref{cosets:cycle_length_theorem}. 
%\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
%\item
%Compute $\sigma^{-1} (b_1)$
%\item
%Compute $\tau (a_1)$
%\item
%Compute $\sigma (a_1)$
%\item
%Using parts (a-c) above, fill in the blanks:
%
%\begin{align*}
%\sigma \tau \sigma^{-1} (b_1) & = \sigma \tau (\sigma^{-1} (b_1)) \\
%&= \sigma \tau (\_\_\_\_)  \textrm{(from part (a))}\\
%&= \sigma(\tau (\_\_\_\_))  \textrm{(def. of composition)}\\
%&= \sigma(\_\_\_\_\_) \textrm{(from part (b))}\\
%& = \_\_\_\_\_ \textrm{(from part (c))}.
%\end{align*}
%
%It follows that $\sigma \tau \sigma^{-1} (b_1) = \mu (\_\_\_\_\_)$.
%\item
%In general, we can write:
%
%\[ \tau (a_j) = a_{(j+1) \bmod k} \]
%
%How would you write $\mu(b_j)$ using a similar notation?
%
%\item
%Follow the proof in (d) to show that:
%
%\[ \sigma \tau \sigma^{-1} (b_j) = \mu(b_j). \]
%\end{enumerate}
%\end{exercise}
%
%One more little result is needed:
%
%\begin{exercise}{NoThreeCycles}
%List all of the 3-cycles in $A_4$.
%\end{exercise}
%
%Now we're ready for the proof, which brings together several of the ideas that we've introduced so far in this book. This is a what is often called ``elegant'' proof: although it's short and easy to write down, in a way it seems that it pulls a ``rabbit out of a hat''. As a foretaste of Chapter~\ref{actions}, we will find that \emph{counting arguments}\index{Counting argument} play an important role.
%
%\begin{thm}\label{cosets_theorem_10}
%The group $A_4$ has no subgroup of order 6.
%\end{thm}
%
%\begin{proof}
%The proof is by contradiction. We suppose that $H$ is a subgroup of $A_4$ or order 6. From Exercise~\ref{exercise:cosets:NoThreeCycles} we know that there are 8 3-cycles in $A_4$.  It follows that $H$ must contain at least 2 3-cycles (since only 6 of them can fit in $A_4 \setminus H$.We will let 
%
%Next let's consider  the cosets of $H$. Since $[A_4 : H] = 2$, there are only two left cosets of $H$ in $A_4$.  Since $H$ is one of these left cosets, the other must be $A_4 \setminus H$. The very same argument shows that the two right cosets of $H$ are also $H$ and $A_4 \setminus H$. It follows that $gH = Hg$, and therefore $g H g^{-1} = H$ for every $g \in A_4$.  
%
%Now comes the punch line. By Proposition~\ref{cosets:cycle_length_theorem}, if $H$ contains one 3-cycle, then it must contain every 3-cycle, contradicting the order of~$H$. \hspace*{1in}
%\end{proof}
%
 
\section{Factor groups and normal subgroups}\label{cosets:normal}
 
We saw in Section~\ref{cosets:def} that if $H$ is a subgroup of a group $G$, then right cosets of $H$ in $G$ are not always the same as left cosets. The \emph{number} of right cosets and left cosets are always equal, and the number of elements in the left and right cosets match; but the right and left cosets \emph{themselves} may not equal each other (it is not always the case that $gH = Hg$ for all $g \in G$).  But as we saw sometimes they do equal each other. The subgroups for which this property holds play a critical role in group theory: they allow for the construction of a new class of groups, called factor or quotient groups. 
% Factor groups may be studied by using homomorphisms, a generalization of isomorphisms. 

\subsection{Normal subgroups}

First, let's give a name to these nice subgroups:

\begin{defn}\label{normal_sub}
A subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ is \term{normal}\index{Subgroup!normal}\index{Normal subgroup} in G if $gH =
Hg$ for all $g \in G$. That is, a normal subgroup of a group $G$ is
one in which the right and left cosets are precisely the same. 
\end{defn}
 
\begin{example}{normal_S3}
Think back to Example~\ref{example:cosets:S3_Cosets} earlier in the chapter.  $H$ was the subgroup of $S_3$ consisting of elements $(1)$ and
$(12)$. Since 
\[
(123) H = \{ (123), (13) \}
\quad
\text{and}
\quad
H (123) = \{ (123), (23) \},
\]
$H$ cannot be a normal subgroup of $S_3$.  However, the subgroup $K$,
consisting of the permutations $(1)$, $(123)$, and $(132)$, is normal
since the cosets of $N$ are 
\[
\begin{array}{c}
N  =   \{ (1), (123), (132) \} \\
(12) N =  N (12)  =  \{ (12), (13), (23) \}.
\end{array}
\]
\end{example}

\begin{exercise}{which_normal}
Looking back at Exercise~\ref{exercise:cosets:left_right_cosets}, which of the subgroups were normal?
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}{SL2_normal}
Is $SL_2( {\mathbb R} )$ a normal subgroup of $GL_2( {\mathbb R})?$  Prove or disprove.
\hyperref[sec:cosets:hints]{(*Hint*)}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}{i_normal}
Is  $\{ 1, -1, i, -i \}$ a normal subgroup of $Q_8$?
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}{abelian_normal} Prove that any subgroup of an abelian group is normal.
\hyperref[sec:cosets:hints]{(*Hint*)}
\end{exercise}

Now let's see if you can prove some general facts about normal subgroups.  Here's an interesting one that's not too hard to prove:

\begin{exercise}{e_normal}
Prove that for \emph{any} group $G$, the set $\{e\}$ is a normal subgroup of $G$ (in other words the identity of group is always a normal subgoup).
\end{exercise} 

And here's an alternative way to characterize normal subgroups:

\begin{exercise}{}
Show that a subgroup $H \subset G$ is normal iff every left coset of $H$ is also a right coset of $H$.
\end{exercise}

The following proposition can be useful when trying to prove that a certain subgroup is normal.  It gives several different characterizations of normal subgroups.
  
\begin{thm}\label{normal:normalequivalents}
Let $G$ be a group and $N$ be a subgroup of $G$. Then the following
statements are equivalent.
\begin{enumerate}
 
\item
The subgroup $N$ is normal in $G$. 
 
\item
For all $g \in G$, $gNg^{-1} \subset N$. 
 
\item
For all $g \in G$, $gNg^{-1} = N$.
 
\end{enumerate}
\end{thm}
 
 
\begin{proof}
(1) $\Rightarrow$ (2).
Since $N$ is normal in $G$, $gN = Ng$ for all $g \in G$. Hence, for a
given $g \in G$ and $n \in N$, there exists an $n'$ in $N$ such that
$g n = n' g$. Therefore, $gng^{-1} = n' \in N$ or $gNg^{-1} \subset
N$.
 
 
(2)  $\Rightarrow$ (3).  
Let $g \in G$. Since $gNg^{-1} \subset N$, we need only show $N
\subset gNg^{-1}$. For $n \in N$,  $g^{-1}ng=g^{-1}n(g^{-1})^{-1} \in
N$.  Hence, $g^{-1}ng = n'$ for some $n' \in N$. Therefore, $n = g n'
g^{-1}$ is in $g N g^{-1}$.
 
 
(3) $\Rightarrow$ (1).
Suppose that $gNg^{-1} = N$ for all $g \in G$. Then for any $n \in N$
there exists an $n' \in N$ such that $gng^{-1} = n'$.  Consequently,
$gn = n' g$ or $gN \subset Ng$. Similarly, $Ng \subset gN$.
\end{proof}
 
 Proposition~\ref{normal:normalequivalents} enables us to formulate an alternative definition for normal subgroups:  

\begin{defn}\label{normal_alt}
 Given a group $G$, a subgroup $H \subset G$ is called a 
\term{normal subgroup}\index{Subgroup!normal} if for every $g \in G$ and for every $h \in H$, we have that $ghg^{-1} \in H$.  (Alternatively, we can write this condition as: $gHg^{-1} = H$.)
\end{defn}

\begin{exercise}{ghg-1_prove}
Prove that Definition~\ref{normal_alt} is equivalent to Definition~\ref{normal_sub}.
\hyperref[sec:cosets:hints]{(*Hint*)}
\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}{normalk}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item
Show that if $H$ is a subgroup of $G$ and $|H|=k$, then for any $g \in G$ it's true that $gHg^{-1}$ is also a subgroup of $G$ and $|gHg^{-1}|=k$.
\item
If a group $G$ has exactly one subgroup $H$ of order $k$, prove that
$H$ is normal in $G$.
\hyperref[sec:cosets:hints]{(*Hint*)}
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

Finally, here's one that will be very useful in a couple of sections.

\begin{exercise}{normal_mult}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item
Let $H \subset G$ be a normal subgroup, and let $g \in G, h \in H$.  Show that $g^{-1}hg \in H$.
\item
Let $H \subset G$ be a normal subgroup, and let $g \in G, h \in H$. Use part (a) to show that there exists an $h' \in H$ such that $hg = g h'$.
\item
Let $H \subset G$ be a normal subgroup, and suppose $x_1 \in g_1H$ and $x_2 \in g_2H$. Prove that $x_1x_2 \in g_1g_2H$.
\hyperref[sec:cosets:hints]{(*Hint*)}
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}  

\subsection{Factor groups}\label{sec:factor_groups}
 
So what's the hubbub about these normal subgroups?  We've been promising a grand revelation.  It turns out that the cosets of normal subgroups have some very special properties.

\begin{example}{factor_Z3}
Consider the normal subgroup $3 {\mathbb Z}$ of ${\mathbb Z}$ that we started exploring at the beginning of the chapter. The cosets of
$3 {\mathbb Z}$ in ${\mathbb Z}$ were
\begin{align*}
0 + 3 {\mathbb Z} & = \{ \ldots, -3, 0, 3, 6, \ldots \} \\
1 + 3 {\mathbb Z} & = \{ \ldots, -2, 1, 4, 7, \ldots \} \\
2 + 3 {\mathbb Z} & = \{ \ldots, -1, 2, 5, 8, \ldots \}.
\end{align*}

Now just for curiosity's sake, let's say we took \emph{every} element in $0 + 3 {\mathbb Z}$ and added them to \emph{every} element in $1 + 3 {\mathbb Z}$.  What would be the resulting set?  Try some examples: take an arbitrary element of $0 + 3 {\mathbb Z}$, and add to it an arbitrary element of $1 + 3 {\mathbb Z}$. You will find that the result is always in $1 + 3 {\mathbb Z}$. Let's give a proof of this. First let's give some notation:

\begin{defn}\label{setplus}(\emph{Set addition})  Let $A$ and $B$ be two sets of real numbers.  Then the \term{sum}\index{Sum!of sets} $A + B$ is defined as the set:
\[ A + B := \{a + b, \mathrm{~where~} a \in A \mathrm{~and~} b \in B\} .\]
\end{defn}
\noindent
Notice that we are giving a \emph{new} meaning to the symbol `+', because we are applying it to \emph{sets} rather than \emph{numbers}. 

In terms of this new notation, what we're trying to prove is:

\[ (0 + 3 {\mathbb Z}) + (1 + 3 {\mathbb Z}) = 1 + 3 {\mathbb Z}. \]

As we've done many times before, we may prove that these two sets are equal by showing that all elements of the left-hand set are contained in the right-hand set, and vice versa. So let's take an arbitrary element of $(0 + 3 {\mathbb Z}) + (1 + 3 {\mathbb Z})$. We may write this element as $(0 + 3m) + (1 + 3n)$, where $m,n \in \ZZ$. Basic algebra gives us:
\[(0 + 3m) + (1 + 3 n) = 1 + 3(m+ n), \]
which is in $1 + 3 {\mathbb Z}$. This shows that: 
\[ (0 + 3 {\mathbb Z}) + (1 + 3 {\mathbb Z}) \subset 1 + 3 {\mathbb Z}. \]
On the other hand, we may write an arbitrary element of $1 + 3 {\mathbb Z}$ as $1 + 3k$, which is equal to  $0 + (1 + 3k)$.  Since $0 \in 0 + 3 {\mathbb Z}$, we have 
\[ (0 + 3 {\mathbb Z}) + (1 + 3 {\mathbb Z}) \supset 1 + 3 {\mathbb Z}, \]
and the proof is complete.

%Looking at it again, the result does make sense; if you take any multiple of $3$ ($1 + 3 {\mathbb Z}$) and add to it any multiple of $3$ plus an extra $1$ ($1 + 3 {\mathbb Z}$), you get get an integer that is a multiple of $3$ plus an extra $1$.  This is like saying that, mod $3$, a zero plus a one is a one.  \emph{And}, if you look at the element signifiers on the front of the cosets in the equation, we have \emph{exactly} that: $0 + 1 = 1$.  So another way to think about the line above is:
%
%\[ (\text{\emph{0}} + 3 {\mathbb Z}) + (\text{\emph{1}} + 3 {\mathbb Z}) = (\text{\emph{$0$}} + \text{\emph{$1$}}) +  3 {\mathbb Z} = 1 + 3 {\mathbb Z} \]
%
%\emph{Now}, instead of adding elements of sets together, we are adding \emph{sets} together, using the elements at the beginning of the cosets to do the work of the `'addition". Let's practice another one:
%
%What is $(1 + 3 {\mathbb Z}) + (2 + 3 {\mathbb Z})$ (think through it in your head first)?
%
%You should get $0 + 3 {\mathbb Z}$, and indeed,
%
%\[ (\text{\emph{1}} + 3 {\mathbb Z}) + (\text{\emph{2}} + 3 {\mathbb Z}) = (\text{\emph{$1$}} + \text{\emph{$2$}}) +  3 {\mathbb Z} = 0 + 3 {\mathbb Z} \pmod{3} \]

Let's step back and see what we've done. We've taken one coset of $ 3 {\mathbb Z}$ (i.e. $0 + 3\ZZ$), and ``added" a second coset (i.e. $1 + 3\ZZ$) to it, to get a third coset of $ 3 {\mathbb Z}$ . This sounds like closure.  We can do the same thing with all pairs of cosets, and obtain the following ``addition'' table: 

%Notice also that 
%The group   ${\mathbb Z}/ 3 {\mathbb Z}$ then is given by the multiplication
%table below. 
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c|ccc}
$+$             & $0 + 3{\mathbb Z}$ & $1 + 3{\mathbb Z}$ & $2 + 3{\mathbb Z}$ \\\hline
$0 + 3{\mathbb Z}$ & $0 + 3{\mathbb Z}$ & $1 + 3{\mathbb Z}$ & $2 + 3{\mathbb Z}$ \\
$1 + 3{\mathbb Z}$ & $1 + 3{\mathbb Z}$ & $2 + 3{\mathbb Z}$ & $0 + 3{\mathbb Z}$ \\
$2 + 3{\mathbb Z}$ & $2 + 3{\mathbb Z}$ & $0 + 3{\mathbb Z}$ & $1 + 3{\mathbb Z}$
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Indeed we have closure.  It's beginning to look like we have a group here. Actually,  we can see an identity ( $0 + 3 {\mathbb Z}$) and an inverse for every coset (for example $[1 + 3 {\mathbb Z}]^{-1}=2 + 3 {\mathbb Z}$). It turns that the associative property also holds: this follows from the associativity of ordinary addition. So we got it: the cosets of $3 {\mathbb Z}$ \emph{themselves} form a group!  (Note the Cayley table for this group looks suspiciously the same as the Cayley table for ${\mathbb Z}_3$; we'll pick up on this in the Isomorphisms chapter.)  
\end{example}

 So \emph{this} is the grand revelation about normal subgroups: \emph{the cosets of a normal subgroup form a group}. But we shouldn't jump the gun: we've only shown it's true for a special case. Now we have to get down to the hard work of proving it in general. First we have to generalize Definition~\ref{setplus} to other group operations.

\begin{defn}\label{setcomp}(\emph{Set composition})  Let $A$ and $B$ be two subsets of a group $G$.  Then the \term{composition}\index{Composition!of sets} $A \circ B$ (or $AB$)  is defined as the set:
\[ A \circ B := \{a b, \mathrm{~where~} a \in A \mathrm{~and~} b \in B\} .\]
\end{defn}

The reason that normal subgroups are special is that set composition defines an operation on cosets:

\begin{thm}\label{norm_comp}
Let $N$ be a normal subgroup of a group $G$. If $a,b \in G$ , then $aN \circ bN = abN$.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
The proof parallels the argument in Example~\ref{example:cosets:factor_Z3}. Let $x \in aN$ and $y \in bN$. 
Using Exercise~\ref{exercise:cosets:normal_mult} part (c), we may conclude that $xy \in abN$.  This shows that $aN \circ bN \subset abN$.  On the other hand,
let $z \in abN$.  Then $z = ae \circ b  n$ for some $n\in N$, which implies that $z \in aN \circ bN$.  This shows that $aN \circ bN \supset abN$, and the proof is finished.
\end{proof}

\begin{thm}
Let $N$ be a normal subgroup of a group $G$. The cosets of $N$ in $G$
form a group under the operation of set composition. 
\end{thm}
  
\begin{proof}
We have shown that the set composition operation is well-defined and closed on the set of cosets of $N$, provided that $N$ is normal. 
Associativity follows by the associativity of the group operation defined on $G$.
Using Proposition~\ref{norm_comp} we have that $eN \circ aN = aN \circ eN = aN$, so $eN = N$ is an identity.  
Proposition~\ref{norm_comp} also gives us that $g^{-1}N \circ gN = gN \circ g^{-1}N = eN$, so the inverse of $gN$ is $g^{-1} N$. 
\end{proof}

Let's define a special notation for our new discovery.

\begin{defn}\label{factor_group} 
If $N$ is a normal subgroup of a group $G$, then the group of cosets of $N$ under the operation of set composition is denoted as $G/N$\label{notefactor} This group is called the \term{factor}\index{Group!factor} or \term{quotient group}\index{Group!quotient} of $G$ and $N$. 
\end{defn} 
Note that the order of $G/N$ is $[G:N]$, the number of cosets of $N$ in $G$. 

 

\begin{rem}
In Example~\ref{example:cosets:factor_Z3} above, the factor group would have been labeled ${\mathbb Z}/ 3 {\mathbb Z}$. In general, the subgroup $n {\mathbb Z}$ of ${\mathbb Z}$ is normal. The
cosets of the factor group ${\mathbb Z } / n {\mathbb Z}$ then are 
\[
n {\mathbb Z};\quad 1 + n {\mathbb Z}; \quad 2 + n {\mathbb Z}; \quad \cdots \quad
(n-1) + n {\mathbb Z}.
\]
and the sum of the cosets $k + {\mathbb Z}$ and $l + {\mathbb Z}$ is $k+l + 
{\mathbb Z}$. Notice that  we have written our cosets additively, 
because the group operation is integer addition. 
\end{rem}


It is very important to remember that the elements in a factor group are not the elements of the original group, but \emph{sets of elements} in the original group. As well then, the operation for the factor group is not the original operation of the group (which was used to compose elements), but a convenient derivative of it that we use to compose sets together.  Both of these facts take a second to get use to, so let's practice:

 
\begin{example}{factor_S3}
Consider the normal subgroup of $S_3, H = \{ (1), (123), (132)  \}$ which we started exploring in Example~\ref{example:cosets:S3_Cosets}.
The cosets of $H$ in $S_3$ were $H$ and $(12) N$. Using the group operation from Defintion~\ref{factor_group} to compose these cosets together, the factor group $S_3
/ N$ then has the following multiplication table.
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c|cc}
         & $N$      & $(12) N$ \\
\hline
$N$      & $N$      & $(12) N$ \\
$(12) N$ & $(12) N$ & $N$
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
%This group is isomorphic to ${\mathbb Z}_2$

Notice that  $S_3 / N$ is a smaller group than $S_3$ ($2$ elements compared to $6$ eleemnts). So the factor group then displays a pared down amount of
information about $S_3$.  Actually, $N = A_3$, the group of even
permutations, and $(12) N = \{ (12), (13), (23) \}$ is the set of odd
permutations. The information captured in $G/N$ is parity; that is,
multiplying two even or two odd permutations results in an even
permutation, whereas multiplying an odd permutation by an even
permutation yields an odd permutation.  This information, as well as the Cayley table above, might suggest to you that the factor group is equivalent to another group we know.  Again, we'll pick up on this in the Isomorphisms chapter. 
\end{example}
 
 


Now it's your turn:

\begin{exercise}{factor_cayley_prac}
Give the multiplication tables for the following factor groups:

\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item
 ${\mathbb Z}/ 4 {\mathbb Z}$

\item
 ${\mathbb Z}/ 6 {\mathbb Z}$
\item
 ${\mathbb Z}_{24} / \langle 8 \rangle$ 

\item
 ${\mathbb Z}_{20} / \langle 4 \rangle$ 

\item
${\mathbb Z}_{6} / \{0,3\}$

\item
${\mathbb Z}_{8} / \{0,4\}$
\item
$U(8) / \langle 3 \rangle$
\item
$U(20) / \langle 3 \rangle$

\end{enumerate}
\end{multicols}
\end{exercise}
 
\begin{example}{factor_Dn}
Consider the dihedral group $D_n$ that we studied in the Symmetries chapter, which was the group of symmetries (rotations and reflections) of a regular $n$ sided polygon.  We determined in the latter part of that chapter that $D_n$ was actually generated by the two elements $r$ and $s$, satisfying the relations 
\begin{align*}
r^n & = id \\
s^2 & = id \\
srs & = r^{-1}.
\end{align*}
The element $r$ generates the cyclic subgroup of rotations,
$R_n$, of $D_n$.  Since $srs^{-1} = srs = r^{-1} \in R_n$, then by Definition~\ref{normal_alt} the group
of rotations is a normal subgroup of $D_n$; therefore, $D_n / R_n$ is
a group.  Now there are $2n$ symmetries in $D_n$ and $n$ rotations in $R_n$; so Lagrange's Theorem tells us the number of cosets, $[D_n : R_n] =  \frac{|D_n|}{|R_n|} = \frac{2n}{n} =2$.  

Since $R_n$, the rotations, are one of the cosets, the reflections must be the other coset.  So the group $D_n / R_n$ boils down to to two elements, rotations and reflections, described by a $2 \times 2$ multiplication table.  
\end{example}

\begin{exercise}{}
Construct the multiplication table for  $D_n / R_n$.

\section{The simplicity of the alternating group}\label{normal:section:simplealternating}
 
 

In the previous section we talked about how a normal subgroup enables us to ``factor'' a group to obtain a group with fewer elements (i.e. the group of cosets.)  In some way this is similar to the idea of factoring positive integers as a product of smaller numbers.  A natural question then is whether there are groups that can't be ``factored'': in other words, Are there groups which have no normal subgroups? 

Actually, in Exercise~\ref{exercise:cosets:e_normal} you've already answered that question: for any group, the identity $\{e\}$ is a normal subgroup.  But factoring by $\{e\}$ doesn't give a group with fewer elements, because the number of cosets of the identity in any group $G$ is (by Lagrange's Theorem)

\[ \frac{|G|}{|\{e\}|} = \frac{|G|}{1} = |G|. \]

\noindent
Thus factoring a group by $\{e\}$ is kind of like dividing an integer by 1: it doesn't change anything. So let's change our question to:  Are there groups which have no \emph{nontrivial} subgroups? Such groups would be like prime numbers: they can't be factored any further.

A group with no nontrivial normal subgroups is called a \term{simple group}\index{Group!simple}\index{Simple group}. In a way, simple groups are the ``prime  numbers'' in group theory. Just like any positive integer uniquely factors into a product of prime numbers,  it turns out that any group can be uniquely factored into a series of simple groups.  (Unfortunately, proving this is beyond the scope of this course.) 

On the other hand, simple groups are somewhat more complicated than prime numbers. There are several infinite classes of simple groups (as well as a few simple groups which defy classification--see the Historical Note at the end of this section.) We've already seen one such  class: the groups of prime order. As we noted following Exercise~\ref{exercise:cosets:prime_simple}, these groups are simple since they have
no nontrivial proper subgroups. 

We'll take the rest of this section to demonstrate another class of simple groups: we'll show that the alternating groups, $A_n$, are simple for
$n \geq 5$. We will prove this result by looking at properties of 3-cycles. The strategy is to establish the following two facts:
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
\item
The only  normal subgroup of $A_n (n \geq 3)$ that contains a 3-cycle is $A_n$ itself.
\item
Any nontrivial normal subgroup of $A_n (n \geq 5)$ contains a 3-cycle.
\end{enumerate}
Logically, (1) and (2)  imply that the only nontrivial normal subgroup of $A_n (n \geq 5)$ is $A_n$ itself.

Before we can prove facts (1) and (2), we need a preliminarly result: 

\begin{thm}\label{normal:3cycle_lemma1}
The alternating group $A_n$ is generated by $3$-cycles for $n \geq 3$.
\end{thm}
 
\begin{proof}
To show that the 3-cycles generate $A_n$, we need only show that any
pair of transpositions can be written as the product of 3-cycles.
Since $(a b) = (b a)$, every pair of transpositions must be one of the
following: 
\begin{align*}
(ab)(ab) & = id \\
(ab)(cd) & = (acb)(acd) \\
(ab)(ac) & = (acb).
\end{align*}
\end{proof}
 
\noindent
Now we're able to prove fact (1).

\begin{thm}\label{normal:3cycle_lemma2}
Let $N$ be a  normal subgroup of $A_n$, where $n \geq 3$. If $N$ 
contains a $3$-cycle, then $N = A_n$. 
\end{thm}
 
 
\begin{proof}
We will first show that $A_n$ is generated by 3-cycles of the specific
form $(ijk)$, where $i$ and $j$ are fixed in  $\{ 1, 2, \ldots, n \}$
and we let $k$ vary. Every 3-cycle is the product of 3-cycles of this 
form, since
\begin{align*}
(i a j) & = (i j a)^2  \\
(i a b) & = (i j b) (i j a)^2 \\
(j a b) & = (i j b)^2 (i j a) \\
(a b c) & = (i j a)^2 (i j c) (i j b)^2 (i j a).
\end{align*}
Now suppose that $N$ is a nontrivial normal subgroup of $A_n$ for $n 
\geq 3$  such that $N$ contains a 3-cycle of the form $(i j a)$. Using
the normality of $N$, we see that
\[
[(i j)(a k)](i j a)^2 [(i j)(a k)]^{-1} = (i j k)
\]
is in $N$. Hence, $N$ must contain all of the 3-cycles $(i j k)$ 
for $1 \leq k \leq n$. By Proposition~\ref{normal:3cycle_lemma1}, these 3-cycles generate $A_n$; 
hence, $N = A_n$. 
\end{proof}
\bigskip
 
\noindent
Let's move on to fact (2):

\begin{thm}\label{normal:3cycle_lemma3}
For $n \geq 5$, every nontrivial normal subgroup $N$ of $A_n$ contains a
$3$-cycle. 
\end{thm}

%TWJ - 1/13/2014
%nontrivial added to the lemma statement.  Suggested by M. Faucette.
 
 
\begin{proof}
Let $\sigma$ be an arbitrary element in a normal subgroup $N$. There
are several possible cycle structures for $\sigma$.
\begin{itemize}
 
\item
$\sigma$ is a 3-cycle.
 
\item
$\sigma$ is the product of disjoint cycles, $\sigma = \tau(a_1 a_2
\cdots a_r) \in N$, where $r >3$.
 
 
\item
$\sigma$ is the product of disjoint cycles, $\sigma = \tau(a_1 a_2
a_3)(a_4 a_5 a_6)$.
 
 
\item
$\sigma = \tau(a_1 a_2 a_3)$, where $\tau$ is the product of disjoint
2-cycles. 
 
 
\item
$\sigma =
\tau (a_1 a_2) (a_3 a_4) $, where $\tau$ is the product of an even
number of disjoint 2-cycles. 
 
 
\end{itemize}
If $\sigma$ is a $3$-cycle, then we are done. If $N$ contains a
product of disjoint cycles, $\sigma$, and at least one of these cycles
has length greater than 3, say $\sigma = \tau(a_1 a_2 \cdots a_r)$,
then   
\[
(a_1 a_2 a_3)\sigma(a_1 a_2 a_3)^{-1}
\]
is in $N$ since $N$ is normal; hence,
\[
\sigma^{-1}(a_1 a_2 a_3)\sigma(a_1 a_2 a_3)^{-1}
\]
is also in $N$. Since
\begin{align*}
\lefteqn{\sigma^{-1}(a_1 a_2 a_3)\sigma(a_1 a_2 a_3)^{-1} } \\
& = \sigma^{-1}(a_1 a_2 a_3)\sigma(a_1 a_3 a_2) \\
& = (a_1 a_2 \cdots a_r)^{-1}\tau^{-1}(a_1 a_2 a_3) 
      \tau(a_1 a_2 \cdots a_r)(a_1 a_3 a_2) \\
& = (a_1 a_r a_{r-1} \cdots a_2 )(a_1 a_2 a_3) 
      (a_1 a_2 \cdots a_r)(a_1 a_3 a_2) \\
& = (a_1 a_3 a_r),
\end{align*}
$N$ must contain a 3-cycle; hence, $N = A_n$.
 
 
 
 
Now suppose that $N$ contains a disjoint product of the form
\[
\sigma = \tau(a_1 a_2 a_3)(a_4 a_5 a_6).
\]
Then
\[
\sigma^{-1}(a_1 a_2 a_4)\sigma(a_1 a_2 a_4)^{-1} \in N
\]
since
\[
(a_1 a_2 a_4)\sigma(a_1 a_2 a_4)^{-1} \in N.
\]
So
\begin{align*}
\lefteqn{\sigma^{-1}(a_1 a_2 a_4)\sigma(a_1 a_2 a_4)^{-1} } \\
& = [ \tau (a_1 a_2 a_3) (a_4 a_5 a_6) ]^{-1}  (a_1 a_2 a_4) 
      \tau (a_1 a_2 a_3) (a_4 a_5 a_6) (a_1 a_2 a_4)^{-1} \\
& = (a_4 a_6 a_5) (a_1 a_3 a_2) \tau^{-1}(a_1 a_2 a_4)  
      \tau (a_1 a_2 a_3) (a_4 a_5 a_6) (a_1 a_4 a_2) \\
& = (a_4 a_6 a_5)(a_1 a_3 a_2) (a_1 a_2 a_4)
      (a_1 a_2 a_3) (a_4 a_5 a_6)(a_1 a_4 a_2) \\
& = (a_1 a_4 a_2 a_6 a_3).
\end{align*}
So $N$ contains a disjoint cycle of length greater than 3, and we can
apply the previous case. 
 
 
Suppose $N$ contains a disjoint product of the form $\sigma = \tau(a_1
a_2 a_3)$, where $\tau$ is the product of disjoint 2-cycles. Since
$\sigma \in N$, $\sigma^2 \in N$, and
\begin{align*}
\sigma^2
& = \tau(a_1 a_2 a_3)\tau(a_1 a_2 a_3) \\
& =(a_1 a_3 a_2).
\end{align*}
So $N$ contains a 3-cycle.
 
 
The only remaining possible case is a disjoint product of the form
\[
\sigma = \tau (a_1 a_2) (a_3 a_4),
\]
where $\tau$ is the product of an even number of disjoint 2-cycles.
But 
\[
\sigma^{-1}(a_1 a_2 a_3)\sigma(a_1 a_2 a_3)^{-1}
\]
is in $N$ since $(a_1 a_2 a_3)\sigma(a_1 a_2 a_3)^{-1}$ is in $N$; and
so 
\begin{align*}
\lefteqn{\sigma^{-1}(a_1 a_2 a_3)\sigma(a_1 a_2 a_3)^{-1} } \\
& = \tau^{-1} (a_1 a_2) (a_3 a_4) (a_1 a_2 a_3) 
      \tau (a_1 a_2)(a_3 a_4)(a_1 a_2 a_3)^{-1} \\
& = (a_1 a_3)(a_2 a_4).
\end{align*}
Since $n \geq 5$, we can find $b \in \{1, 2, \ldots, n \}$ such that
$b \neq a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4$. Let $\mu = (a_1 a_3 b)$. Then
\[
\mu^{-1} (a_1 a_3)(a_2 a_4) \mu (a_1 a_3)(a_2 a_4) \in N
\]
and
\begin{align*}
\lefteqn{\mu^{-1} (a_1 a_3)(a_2 a_4) \mu (a_1 a_3)(a_2 a_4) } \\
& = (a_1 b a_3)(a_1 a_3)(a_2 a_4) 
      (a_1 a_3 b)(a_1 a_3)(a_2 a_4) \\
& = (a_1 a_3 b ).
\end{align*}
Therefore, $N$ contains a 3-cycle. This completes the proof of the
proposition.  
\end{proof}
 
So finally we may summarize the proof that $A_n$ is simple $(n \geq 5)$.

\begin{thm}\label{normal:An_simple}
The alternating group, $A_n$, is simple for $n \geq 5$. 
\end{thm}
 
\begin{proof}
Let $N$ be a normal subgroup of $A_n$. By Proposition~\ref{normal:3cycle_lemma3}, $N$ contains a
3-cycle. By Proposition~\ref{normal:3cycle_lemma2}, $N = A_n$; therefore, $A_n$ contains no proper
nontrivial normal subgroups for $n \geq 5$.
\end{proof} 
 
And there we have it, $A_n$ is a simple group for $n \geq 5$.  Simple, right? :)

\noindent{\small \histf
It is impossible to overstate the importance of simple groups in mathematics and physics. 
Groups are the fundamental mathematical tools used to describe the symmetries and regularities which we observe in the physical world--and finite groups, as mentioned in the text, are the building blocks from which all finite groups may be built.

The earliest work on the classification problem dates back over 200 years.  The first nonabelian simple groups to be discovered were the alternating groups, and Galois was the first to prove that $A_5$ was
simple. Later mathematicians, such as C.~Jordan\index{Jordan, C.} and
L.~E.~Dickson,\index{Dickson, L. E.} found several infinite families of
matrix groups that were simple. Other families of simple groups were
discovered in the 1950s.  Around 1900 William
Burnside\index{Burnside's conjecture} conjectured that all nonabelian
simple groups must have even order. But it wasn't until 1963 that
 Walter Feit and John Thompson published a 250-page  proof of Burnside's conjecture.
After this breakthrough, mathematicians redoubled their efforts to complete the classification. Hundreds of mathematicians produced thousands of pages of proofs. Success was announced in 1983, but a gap was later discovered, and it was not until 2004 that one of the greatest intellectual achievements of all time was finally accomplished. The final result:  all finite simple groups belong to 18 countably infinite families, except for 26 exceptional ``sporadic'' groups\index{Group!sporadic}.  The largest of these groups (called the ``monster''\index{Group!monster} has over 80 trillion trillion trillion trillion entries-- which is more than 100 times the number of atoms in the earth.
