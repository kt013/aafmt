\chap{Abstract Groups: Definitions and Basic Properties}{groups}

You may have noticed that we have been voyaging deeper and deeper into unfamiliar mathematical territory. We're using more symbols and fewer numbers. We introduce unfamiliar terminology and strange notation. We deal with outlandish mathematical objects that are harder and harder to visualize. 

Please rest assured that these elaborations have a practical purpose\footnote{(that is, besides tormenting math students)}. We live in a complicated world, and complicated mathematical structures are needed to describe it well. However, underlying this confusing tangle of complicated structures are some deep commonalities. The purpose of abstraction is to identify and characterize these commonalities. In this way we can make connections between very different fields of mathematics, and gain a much more wholistic view of how things work together.
 
One of the commonalities that we have been (more or less) subtly emphasizing in the previous chapters is the ubiquity of \emph{groups}, together with related notions such as isomorphisms and subgroups. Now that you've studies several specific groups (such as ${\mathbb C}, {\mathbb Z}_n, D_n, S_n, A_n$ and so on) our hope is that from these examples you've begun to get a feel for how groups work, and how one should think about groups in general. In this chapter, we will study groups \emph{in the abstract}: that is, we will describe properties that are common to \emph{all} groups, whether finite or infinite, abelian or non-abelian, and so on.
\footnote{Thanks to Tom Judson for material used in this chapter.}

%What you've seen of groups is only the very beginning. There are groups (and applications of groups) that are almost unimaginably bizarre. To paraphrase Shakespeare:  ``There are more groups in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy.''\footnote{Hamlet, Act 1 Scene V.} But no matter how bizarre, all of these groups must obey the fundamental properties of groups -- which is why we now turn to study groups in the abstract.  
% In the last chapter we turned a corner in our study of abstract algebra.  In Chapters~\ref{complex} through \ref{symmetries} we did lots of "regular" algebra, that is, we represented various numbers with variables, and manipulated equations with these variables.  We then took those variables and organized them into sets, functions, groups, Cayley tables, etc.; into generalized structures.  Some of this was not what you had seen in Algebra before, but it wasn't a stretch to come up with or hard to understand based on the algebra you know.  It was simply representing the world with variables.   But in Permutations we started the real stretch that turns regular algebra into abstract algebra.  We took those variables and structures and started to generalize \emph{them}; we started to generalize our structures, our groups, into even more general representations.  In the process we also generalized concepts:  isomorphic groups are like equivalent elements; subgroups are like subsets; the order of a set has an analogous meaning to that of absolute value.
% It is this process of generalizing generalizations that is the crux of studying and thinking Abstract Algebra.  Because if we can generalize a structure or concept to its highest point, and then discover some property about that generalization, then all examples that fit that generalization have to have that same property.  Therefore instead of deeply studying multitudes of different phenomena and contexts in our world and seeing how their parts interact, if we can show that those phenomena and parts fit a generalization, then we know immediately that all properties of that group will show up in that phenomena and the interaction of its parts.  We can deductively know things about the order and operation of this universe without having to inductively test and rigorously prove a theory.  

%Abstract Algebra is logic and Algebra on steroids. 
%So let's generalize our first generalization:  Groups.

\section{Formal definition of a group}\label{groups_section_define}

Historically, the theory of groups first arose from attempts to find the roots of polynomials in terms of their coefficients.  But groups have moved far beyond their original application, and now play a central role in such areas as coding theory, counting, and the study of  symmetries. Many areas of biology, chemistry, and physics have benefited from group theory. In the preceding chapters we've already worked with a number of different groups, including the integers mod $n$ and the symmetries of a rectangle or regular polygon. Recall that a group basically consists of a set and a ``compatible'' operation:

\begin{exercise}{}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item
What operation is the set ${\mathbb Z}_n$ a group under?
\item
What operation is the set $S_3$ a group under?
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}
The following definition formalizes the notion of ``operation''.

\begin{defn} \label{group_op}
 A \term{binary operation}\index{Binary!operation}\index{Operation!binary} or \term{law of composition}\index{Composition!law of}\index{Operation!binary} on a set $G$ is a function $G \times G \rightarrow G$ that assigns to each pair $(a,b) \in G \times G$ a unique element $a \circ b$, or $ab$ in $G$, called the \term{composition} of $a$ and $b$.
\end{defn}

\begin{rem}
\begin{itemize}
\item
Notice that the word ''composition'' is now used to denote any operation on the elements of a set, and not just composition of functions.
\item
When the law of composition on a set is a basic algebraic operation such as multiplication or addition, we'll call it with its usual name.  When it isn't, we will often refer to $a \circ b$  as the ``product'' of $a$ and $b$  (as we did in the Permutations chapter).
\end{itemize}
\end{rem}

In the Modular Arithmetic chapter we introduced what properties a set and operation must have to be called a group:

\begin{exercise}{}
What are the four properties a set $G$ and a binary operation must exhibit in order for the set to be a group under that binary operation?
\end{exercise}
Building on our previous discussion, we now  proudly present the following formal definition.

\begin{defn}\label{group_definition}
 A \term{group}\index{Group!definition of} $(G, \circ )$ is a set $G$ together with a law of composition $(a,b) \mapsto a \circ b$ that satisfies the following axioms. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item
The set $G$ is \term{closed} under the law of composition.  That is, 
\[
\forall a,b \in G, a \circ b = c \mbox{ for some } c \in G .
\]
\item
There exists an element $e \in G$, called the \term{identity element}\index{Element!identity}\index{Identity!element}, such that for any element $a \in G$ 
\[
e \circ a = a \circ e = a.
\]
\item
For each element $a \in G$, there exists an \term{inverse element}\index{Element!inverse}\index{Inverse!element} in G, denoted by $a^{-1}$, such that 
\[
a \circ a^{-1} = a^{-1} \circ a = e.
\]
\item
The law of composition is \term{associative}. That is,
\[
(a \circ b) \circ c = a \circ (b \circ c)
\]
for $a, b, c \in G$.
 
\end{enumerate}
\end{defn}

\begin{rem}
When the group operation is obvious or has been previously specified, we may denote the group by $G$ rather than $(G,\circ)$.  For instance, the group of integers under addition is typically denoted by ${\mathbb Z}$ and not $({\mathbb Z},+)$, since the operation $+$ is understood. 
\end{rem}

One very important class of groups is the commutative groups, which are given their own special designation:

\begin{defn} \label{abelian_group} 
A group $(G,\circ)$ with the property that $a \circ b = b \circ a$ for all $a, b \in G$ is called \term{abelian}\index{abelian group}\index{Group!abelian}\footnote{In honor of Neils Henrik Abel (1802-1829), an astounding mathematician who sadly died very young of tuberculosis. There is some discussion among mathematicians over whether `abelian' should be capitalized. The word has become so common in mathematics that it's usually treated as a regular word and not a proper name. This should be considered as a special honor to Abel, since his name has become part of the fundamental language of mathematics.}  or \term{commutative}\index{Group!commutative}.  Groups not satisfying this property are said to be  \term{non-abelian}\index{Group!non-abelian} or \term{noncommutative}\index{Group!noncommutative}. 
\end{defn}

Finally, based on our discussion before about the order of sets, we have:

\begin{defn} \label{group_order}
A group is \term{finite}\index{Group!finite}, or has \term{finite
order}, if it contains a finite number of elements The \term{order}\index{Group!order of}
of a finite group is the number of elements that it contains. If $G$
is a group containing $n$ elements, we write $|G| =
n$. A group that is not finite is called \term{infinite}, and such a group is said to be of \term{infinite
order}\index{Group!infinite}.
\end{defn} 

The group ${\mathbb Z}_5$ is a finite group of order
5, so $|{\mathbb Z}_5=5$; while the integers ${\mathbb Z}$ form an infinite group under addition, and
we sometimes write $|{\mathbb Z}| = \infty$.

\begin{defn} \label{trivial_group}
The \term{trivial group}\index{Group!trivial}, consists of the single element $e$  (or ${\var id}$, in our previous notation).
\end{defn} 

\begin{exercise}{}
Prove that the trivial group is in fact a group according to Definition~\ref{group_definition}.
\end{exercise}

\section{Examples}

There are multitudes upon multitudes of groups besides those we've seen so far.  Some are modification of groups we are very familiar with.  

\begin{example}{Rstar_group}
The set ${\mathbb R} \setminus \{0 \}$ of non-zero real numbers is written as ${\mathbb R}^{\ast}$.  Let's prove that $({\mathbb R}^{\ast}, \cdot)$ is a group.
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
\item
Closure:  

\noindent
Suppose $a, b \in {\mathbb R}^{\ast}$.  Then to prove closure we must show $ab \in {\mathbb R}^{\ast}$; that is, we must show (i)
$ab \in {\mathbb R}$ and (ii) $ab \neq 0$:

\medskip{}
\noindent
(i):  Since $a, b \in {\mathbb R}$, and we know ${\mathbb R}$ is closed under multiplication, then $ab \in {\mathbb R}$.

\medskip{}
\noindent
(ii):  Suppose $ab = 0$.  Then by basic arithmetic, we know either $a = 0$ or $b = 0$.  But $a, b \in {\mathbb R}^{\ast}$; i.e. $a, b \neq 0$.  So we have a contradiction.  Hence $ab \neq 0$.

\medskip{}
\noindent
Therefore $ab \in {\mathbb R}^{\ast}$; and so ${\mathbb R}^{\ast}$  is closed under multiplication.
\end{enumerate}
To finish the proof that ${\mathbb R}^{\ast}$ is a group, we must establish axioms (2) through (4) in Definition~\ref{group_definition}. We leave this up to you in the following exercise:

\begin{exercise}{Rstar_group} 
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item
Finish proving that $({\mathbb R}^{\ast}, \cdot)$ is a group.
\item
Either prove or disprove that $({\mathbb R}^{\ast}, +)$ is a group.
\item
What is the order of $({\mathbb R}^{\ast}, \cdot)$?
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}
  \end{example}


\begin{exercise}{C_star}
Let ${\mathbb C}^{\ast} $\label{noteCstar} be the set of non-zero complex 
numbers. 
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item
Why is ${\mathbb C}^{\ast}$ not a group under the operation of complex addition?
\item
Prove ${\mathbb C}^{\ast}$ is a group under the operation of (complex) multiplication.
\item
What is $| ({\mathbb C}^{\ast}, \cdot) |$?
\item
Is $({\mathbb C}^{\ast}, \cdot)$ an abelian group?  Justify your answer.
\end{enumerate}  
\end{exercise}

\begin{rem}
Groups based on sets of numbers that \emph{include} 0 (such as ${\mathbb R}, {\mathbb C}, {\mathbb Q}$)are assumed to have the group operation $+$ (unless otherwise stated). For groups based on sets of numbers that \emph{exclude} $0$ such as ${\mathbb R^\ast}, {\mathbb C^\ast}, {\mathbb Q^\ast}$, the group operation is assumed to be multiplication (unless otherwise stated).
\end{rem}
 
\begin{exercise}{15}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item
Why is it impossible for a set of numbers $S$ that includes 0 to be a group under multiplication?  (There is one exception to this rule: what is it?)
\item
 Why is it impossible for a set of numbers $S$ that excludes 0 to be a group under addition?
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise} 
 
Some groups use exotic operations that you may never have seen before:

\begin{example}{S_group}
Let $S = {\mathbb R} \setminus \{ -1 \}$ and define a binary operation on
$S$ by $a \ast b = a + b +ab$. It turns out that $(S, \ast)$ is an abelian group. We will prove closure and the commutative property; the rest of the proof will be left to you.
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
\item
Closure:  Suppose $a, b \in S$.  We need to show that $a \ast b \in S$; i.e. that (i) $a \ast b \in {\mathbb R}$ and (ii) $a \ast b \neq -1$.
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item
By the closure of $({\mathbb R}, +), (a + b) \in {\mathbb R}$.  By the closure of $({\mathbb R}, \ast), (ab) \in {\mathbb R}$.  Finally, by the closure of $({\mathbb R}, +), ((a + b) + (ab)) \in {\mathbb R}$.  
It follows that $a \ast b \in {\mathbb R}$, so $S$ is closed under $\ast$.

\item
Suppose that $a \ast b = -1$.  Then by definition of $\ast$, $a + b +ab = -1$.  Solving for $a$, we get
\begin{center}
$a = \dfrac{-1(b + 1)}{b + 1}$, or $a = -1$
\end{center}  

But since $a \in S, a \neq -1$.  So we have a contradiction.  Hence $a \ast b \neq -1$. This completes the proof that $(S, \ast)$ is closed.
\end{enumerate}

\item
Commutativity:  Suppose $a, b \in S$.  We need to show that $a \ast b = b \ast a$:
\begin{itemize}
\item
First, by the definition of the operation $\ast$ we have $a \ast b = a + b +ab$.
\item
Next, since ${\mathbb R}$ is commutative under addition and multiplication, 
it follows that $a + b = b + a$ and $ab = ba$. 
Adding these two equations, we have $(a + b) + (ab) = (b + a) + (ba)$.
\item
By the definition of $\ast$, $(b + a) + (ba) = b \ast a$.
\item
Putting all these equalities together, we have $a \ast b = a + b +ab = b + a + ba = b \ast a$
\end{itemize}

This completes the proof that $(S, \ast)$ is commutative.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{exercise}{S_group}
Finish the proof that $(S, \ast)$ is an abelian group.
\end{exercise}
\end{example}

\medskip{}
Other groups use operations that are not the usual addition or multiplication.

\begin{exercise}{integer_coordinate_plane}
Let $H = {\mathbb Z} \times {\mathbb Z}$ (all integer coordinate-pairs).
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item
Define a binary operation $\circ$ on $H$ by  $(a,b) \circ (c,d) = (a + c , b + d)$, for $(a,b), (c,d) \in H$.  This operation is in fact just coordinate-pair addition.  Is $(H , \circ)$ a group?  If so, is $(H , \circ)$ abelian?  Justify your answers.
\item
Define a binary operation $\circ$ on $H$ by $(a,b) \circ (c,d) = (ac , bd)$, for $(a,b), (c,d) \in H$.  This is just coordinate-pair multiplication.  Is $(H , \circ)$ a group?  If so, is $(H , \circ)$ abelian? Justify your answers.
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}{19}
Let $G = {\mathbb R}^{\ast} \times {\mathbb Z}$ (all pairs such that the first element is a nonzero real number, and the second is an integer) 
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item
Define a binary operation $\circ$ on $G$ by $(a,m) \circ (b,n) = (a+b, m+n)$.  Is $(G , \circ)$ a group?  If so, is $(G , \circ)$ abelian?  Justify your answers.
\item
Define a binary operation $\circ$ on $G$ by $(a,m) \circ (b,n) = (ab, mn)$.  Is $(G , \circ)$ a group?  If so, is $(G , \circ)$ abelian?  Justify your answers.
\item
Define a binary operation $\circ$ on $G$ by $(a,m) \circ (b,n) = (ab, m+n)$.  Is $(G , \circ)$ a group?  If so, is $(G , \circ)$ abelian?  Justify your answers.
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}
The previous two exercises follow a pattern that we may generalize:

\begin{defn}\label{def:ProductOfGroups}
Given two groups $G$ and $H$, we define the \term{product} of groups $G$ and $H$ (denoted by $G \times H$) as the set of pairs $\left\{(g,h), g \in G, h \in H \right\}$. If $(g_1, h_1)$ and $(g_2,h_2)$ are two elements of $G \times H$, then we define the group operation  $(g_1, h_1) \circ (g_2, h_2)$ as follows:\index{Product!of groups} 
\[ (g_1, h_1) \circ (g_2, h_2) := (g_1g_2, h_1h_2),\]
where $g_1g_2$ uses the group operation in $G$ and $h_1h_2$ uses the group operation in $H$.
\end{defn}

\begin{exercise}{}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item
Consider $(3,6)$ and $(2,4)$ as elements of ${\mathbb Z_7} \times {\mathbb Z_7}$. Compute 
$(3,6) \circ (2,4)$.
\item
Consider $(3,6)$ and $(2,4)$ as elements of ${\mathbb R}^{\ast} \times {\mathbb Z_{10}}$. Compute 
$(3,6) \circ (2,4)$.
\item
Consider $(3,6)$ and $(2,4)$ as elements of ${\mathbb Q}^{\ast} \times {\mathbb Q}^{\ast}$. Compute 
$(3,6) \circ (2,4)$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

In previous chapters we've used Cayley tables\index{Cayley table} to describe group operations.  With Cayley tables we can prove a set and operation are a group even when we don't know what the elements in the set really are or what the binary operation is.


The next two exercises are very useful in the  subsequent exercises.

\begin{exercise}{ident}
Given two elements $g,h$  of a group ($G,\circ$). Show that $g$ is the identity element of $G$ if and only if  $g \circ h = h$.
\hyperref[sec:groups:hints]{(*Hint*)} 
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}{cayley}
Show that if $G$ is a group, then for every row of the Cayley table for $G$ no two entries are the same. Show also that for every column of the Cayley table no two entries are the same.
\hyperref[sec:groups:hints]{(*Hint*)}  
\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}{Cayley_groups}
For each of the following multiplication tables defined on the set $G = \{ a, b, c, d \}$ tell whether $(G, \circ)$ represents a group, and if so,  whether it is abelian.  Support your answer in each case.  Assume that the associative property holds in each case. \emph{Note} the identity element is not necessarily in the first row!

\subsection{The group of units of ${\mathbb Z}_n$ \label{subsec:GroupOfUnits}}

Back in the Modular Arithmetic chapter, we used the addition table for ${\mathbb Z}_8$ to show that ${\mathbb Z}_8$ with modular addition was a group.  We extended this and showed that ${\mathbb Z}_n$ under modular addition is a group for any $n$.  But we ran into problems with modular multiplication on ${\mathbb Z}_8$, as we can see from the Cayley table (reproduced below),

\begin{table}[htb]
\caption{Cayley table for $({\mathbb Z}_8, \cdot)$\label{CayleyZ8mult}}
{ \small
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c|cccccccc}
$\odot$ & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 \\
\hline
0       & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
1       & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 \\
2       & 0 & 2 & 4 & 6 & 0 & 2 & 4 & 6 \\
3       & 0 & 3 & 6 & 1 & 4 & 7 & 2 & 5 \\
4       & 0 & 4 & 0 & 4 & 0 & 4 & 0 & 4 \\
5       & 0 & 5 & 2 & 7 & 4 & 1 & 6 & 3 \\
6       & 0 & 6 & 4 & 2 & 0 & 6 & 4 & 2 \\
7       & 0 & 7 & 6 & 5 & 4 & 3 & 2 & 1
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
}
\end{table}

From Table~\ref{CayleyZ8mult} we can see several problems. Notice that $0,2,4,6$ have no inverses.  In fact, from Table~\ref{CayleyZ8mult} we see that only numbers that are relatively prime to 8 have inverses in ${\mathbb Z}_8$.  The same is true for any ${\mathbb Z}_n$. It follows that in order to get a group under modular multiplication using the elements of ${\mathbb Z}_n$, we'll have to kick out  the non-relatively prime numbers in order to guarantee that every element has an inverse.  For instance,Table~\ref{CayleyU8} is the result when Table~ $\ref{CayleyZ8mult}$  is restricted to the rows and columns labelled $(1, 3, 5, \mbox{ and } 7)$.

\begin{table}[htb] 
\caption{Multiplication table for $U(8)$ \label{CayleyU8}}
{\small
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c|cccc}

\end{table}

\begin{exercise}{27}
Prove that the Cayley table in Table~\ref{CayleyU8} represents a group. (Note that associativity holds because we already know that modular multiplication is associative.)
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}{28}
Is the group in Table ~\ref{CayleyU8} abelian?  Justify your answer.
\end{exercise}
For convenience, let's define some notation:

\begin{defn}\label{DefnOfUnits}
The set of nonzero numbers in ${\mathbb Z}_n$ that are relatively prime to $n$ is called the \term{set of units of ${\mathbb Z}_n$}, denoted by \term{$U(n)$}\index{Units! group of ($U(n)$)}\index{Group!of units $U(n)$}.
\end{defn}

  We have just seen that  $U(8)$ is a group under modular multiplication.  One might suspect that  $U(n)$ is a group for any $n$.  For starters, it is clear that $1$ serves as an  identity element, because $1\cdot k \equiv k \cdot 1 \equiv  k$ mod $n$ for any $n$. In fact, $U(n)$ is an abelian group, as you will show in the following exercises.

\begin{exercise}{U(n)_abgroup}
In this exercise, we prove that $U(n)$ is a group under multiplication mod $n$ for any $n$. We know that modular multiplication is associative, so it remains to show the closure and inverse properties.  
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item
Fill in the blanks to show that $U(n)$ is closed under modular multiplication:

Let $k,m$ be arbitrary elements of  $U(n)$. It follows that both $k$ and \underline{~<1>~} are relatively prime to \underline{~<2>~}. So neither $k$ nor \underline{~<3>~} has any prime factors in common with \underline{~<4>~}. It follows that the product \underline{~<5>~} also has no prime factors in common with \underline{~<6>~}. Furthermore, the remainder of \underline{~<7>~} under division by \underline{~<8>~} also has no prime factors in common with \underline{~<9>~}. Therefore the product of \underline{~<10>~} and \underline{~<11>~} under modular multiplication is also an element of \underline{~<12>~}, so \underline{~<13>~} is closed under modular multiplication.
\item
It remains to show that $U(n)$ is closed under inverse. Suppose that $m \in U(n)$ and $x$ is the inverse of $m$. What equation must $x$ satisfy?
\hyperref[sec:groups:hints]{(*Hint*)}
\item Show that the equation in $x$ that you wrote in part (b) has a solution as long as $m$ is relatively prime to $n$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}  

\begin{exercise}{UnAbel}
Show that $U(n)$ is abelian.
\end{exercise}

\begin{rem}
Whenever we talk about the group $U(n)$, we always assume the operation is multiplication. Similarly, whenever we talk about ${\mathbb Z}_n$, we always assume the operation is addition.
\end{rem}

\subsection{Groups of matrices}
Finally, matrices provide many examples of interesting groups.

\begin{exercise}{M2x2_group}
We use  ${\mathbb M}_2 ( {\mathbb R})$\label{notematrices} to denote the set of all $2 \times 2$ matrices.  That is
\[
{\mathbb M}_2 ( {\mathbb R}) = \left\{ 
\begin{pmatrix}
a & b \\
c & d
\end{pmatrix} ~|~ a,b,c,d \in {\mathbb R} \right\} \]

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item
Is ${\mathbb M}_2 ( {\mathbb R})$ a group under matrix addition? Is it abelian? Justify your answers.
\item
Is ${\mathbb M}_2 ( {\mathbb R})$ a group under matrix multiplication? Is it abelian? Justify your answers.
\item
What is the order of the group from a) or b) above?
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise} 

\begin{exercise}{GL2_group}
Let $GL_2({\mathbb R})$ be the subset of ${\mathbb M}_2 ( {\mathbb R})$ consisting of invertible matrices; that is, a matrix 
\[
A =
\begin{pmatrix}
a & b \\
c & d
\end{pmatrix}
\]
is in  $GL_2( {\mathbb R})$ if there exists a matrix $A^{-1}$ such that
$A A^{-1} = A^{-1} A = I$, where $I$ is the $2 \times 2$ identity
matrix. For $A$ to have an inverse is equivalent to requiring that the
determinant of $A$ be nonzero; that is, $\det A = ad - bc \neq
0$\label{determinant}. The set of invertible matrices forms a group
called the \term{general linear group}\index{Group!general
linear $(GL_n(\mathbb{R}))$ }\label{generallinear}.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item
Prove that $GL_2({\mathbb R})$ is a group under matrix multiplication.
\item
Is the general linear group abelian?  Justify your answer.
\item
What is $| GL_2( {\mathbb R}) |$?
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}
 
\section{Basic properties of groups}
 
Now that we have a general definition of groups, we can use this definition to prove properties that are true of \emph{all} groups. We'll begin by proving some essential properties that we've shown for specific groups, but need to know in general:

\begin{prop}{id_unique}
The identity element in a group $G$ is unique; that is, there exists
only one element $e \in G$ such that $eg = ge = g$ for all $g \in G$. 
\end{prop}
 
\begin{rem}
The following proof follows the classic format used to prove that something is unique: assume instead there are two of them, then either derive a contradiction or show that the two things are really equal.  We will employ the latter.
\end{rem}
 
\begin{proof}
Suppose that $e$ and $e'$ are both identities in $G$. Then $eg = ge =
g$ and $e'g = ge' = g$ for all $g \in G$. We need to show that $e =
e'$. If we think of $e$ as the identity, then $ee' = e'$; but if $e'$
is the identity, then $ee' = e$. Combining these two equations, we
have $e = ee' = e'$. 
\end{proof}
 
 Proposition~\ref{proposition:groups:id_unique} shows that group identities are unique -- it turns out that inverses in a group are also unique:
 
\begin{prop}{inv_unique}
If $g$ is any element in a group $G$, then the inverse of $g$
, is unique. 
\end{prop}


\begin{exercise}{}
Fill in the blanks to complete the following proof of Proposition~\ref{proposition:groups:inv_unique}.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item
By the definition of inverse, if $g'$ is an inverse of an element $g$ in a group $G$, then 
\noindent
$g \cdot \underline{~<1>~} = g' \cdot \underline{~<2>~} = e$.

\item
Similarly, if $g''$ is an inverse of $g$ then  $g \cdot \underline{~<3>~} = \underline{~<4>~} \cdot g = e$. 
\item
We may show that $g' = g''$ as follows:
\begin{align*}
g' & = g' \cdot \underline{~<5>~}  &\text{ (definition of identity) } \\
    & = g' \cdot (\underline{~<6>~} \cdot g'') &\text{ (part b above, def. of inverse) } \\
    & = (g' \cdot g) \cdot \underline{~<7>~}  &\text{ (associative property of group G) } \\
    & = \underline{~<8>~} \cdot g'' &\text{ (part a above, def. of inverse) } \\
    & = g'' &\text{ (def. of identity) }
\end{align*} 
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}{39}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item
Consider the group ${\mathbb C}^{\ast}$, and let  $a = 5 + 3i  \in {\mathbb C}^{\ast}$.  What is $a^{-1}$? 
\item
Consider the group defined by the set $S = {\mathbb R} \setminus \{ -1 \}$ and the binary operation $a \ast b = a + b +ab$.  What is $5^{-1}$? 
\item
Consider the group defined by the set $G = {\mathbb R}^{\ast} \times {\mathbb Z}$ and the operation $(a,m) \circ (b,n) = (ab, m+n)$.  What is $(3,2)^{-1}$?
\item
Consider the group $U(12)$.  What is $5^{-1}$?
\item
Consider the group $GL_2({\mathbb R})$.  What is 
$\begin{pmatrix}
4 & 3 \\
3 & 2
\end{pmatrix}^{-1}$?
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}{}

\noindent
An important property of inverses is:

\begin{prop}{group_inv_reverse}
Let $G$ be a group. If $a, b \in G$, then $(ab)^{-1} = b^{-1}a^{-1}$. 
\end{prop}

\begin{rem}
We've actually seen this property before, in the permutations chapter: recall that for two permutations $\sigma$ and $\tau$, we showed that
$(\sigma \tau)^{-1} = \tau^{-1} \sigma^{-1}.$
\end{rem}

\begin{proof}
By the inverse property, $ \exists a^{-1}, b^{-1} \in G$. By the closure property, $ab \in G$ and $b^{-1}a^{-1} \in G$. So
we only need to verify that $b^{-1}a^{-1}$ satisfies the definition of inverse (from Proposition~\ref{proposition:groups:inv_unique}, we know the inverse is unique). First, we have:    
\begin{align*}
(ab)(b^{-1}a^{-1}) & = a(bb^{-1})a^{-1}  \text{ (associative property of group G) } \\
 & = aea^{-1}  \text{ (def. of inverse) } \\
 & = aa^{-1}  \text{ (def. of identity) } \\
 & = e.  \text{ (def. of inverse) }
\end{align*}

\noindent
The remainder of the proof is left as an exercise:

\begin{exercise}{42}
Fill in the blanks to complete the proof of Proposition~\ref{proposition:groups:group_inv_reverse}
\begin{align*}
(b^{-1}a^{-1})(ab) & = b^{-1}(a^{-1}a)b  &(\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_) \\
 & = b^{-1}eb  &(\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_) \\
 & = b^{-1}b  &(\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_) \\
 & = e.  &(\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_)
\end{align*}
\end{exercise}
\end{proof}

 
Proposition~\ref{proposition:groups:group_inv_reverse} characterizes the inverse of a product: now we shall characterize the inverse of an inverse. From ordinary algebra we know that $-(-a) = a$ and $1/(1/a) = a$. This generalizes to arbitrary groups as follows:

\begin{prop}{}
Let $G$ be a group.  For any $a \in G$, $(a^{-1})^{-1} = a$.
\end{prop}
 
\begin{proof}
If $a \in G$, then since $G$ is a group, then $a^{-1} \in G$ exists.  And again, since $G$ is a group, there also exists $(a^{-1})^{-1} \in G$.

Now, by the definition of inverse, $a^{-1} (a^{-1})^{-1} = e$. Consequently, multiplying both sides of this equation by $a$, we have  (the argument continues in the following exercise):

\begin{exercise}{44}
\begin{align*}
a(a^{-1}(a^{-1})^{-1}) & = ae &\mbox{(multiplication by}~a)\\
(aa^{-1})(a^{-1})^{-1} & = ae   &(\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_) \\
e(a^{-1})^{-1} & = ae   &(\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_) \\
(a^{-1})^{-1} &= a.  &(\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_)
\end{align*}
\end{exercise}
\end{proof}

\begin{exercise}{}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item
Suppose $a,b \in {\mathbb C}^{\ast}$, where $a = 4 + 3i$ and $b = 5 - 12i$.  What is $(ab)^{-1}$?  What is $(ba)^{-1}$?
\item
Suppose $a,b \in G$, where G is the group defined by the set $S = {\mathbb R} \setminus \{ -1 \}$ and the binary operation $a \ast b = a + b +ab$.  If $a = 10, b = 1$, what is $(ab)^{-1}$?  What is $(ba)^{-1}$?

5 & -2 \\
2 & -1
\end{pmatrix} \]

What is $(ab)^{-1}$?  What is $(ba)^{-1}$?
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}{}

\begin{exercise}{}
Given a group $G$ and $a, b \in G$, prove that $G$ is abelian if and only if $(ab)^{-1} =a^{-1}b^{-1}$.
\end{exercise}
 
In high school algebra we wrote equations like $6 + x = -\sqrt{2}$ or $5x = 6$, and we could always find a real number $x$ that was a solution.  Now we know that ${\mathbb R}$ is a group under addition and multiplication.  Similarly, we have seen that  equations like $ax = b \pmod{n}$ and $a + x = b \pmod{n}$ had solutions for $x \in U(n)$ and $x \in {\mathbb Z}_n$, respectively. 

Noticing a pattern here, the question then is this:  does the equation $ax = b$ have a solution for any group $G$? 
In other words, if $a$ and $b$ are two elements in a group $G$, does there 
exist an element $x \in G$ such that $ax = b$? If such an $x$ does
exist, is it unique? The following proposition answers both of these
questions affirmatively. 
  
\begin{prop}{group_equations}
Let $G$ be a group and $a$ and $b$ be any two elements in $G$. Then
the equations $ax = b$ and $xa = b$ have unique solutions in $G$. 
\end{prop}

\noindent
Note we need separate proofs to show that $x$ exists and is unique for both $ax =b$ and $xa = b$, since we don't know whether the group is abelian.  The proof for $ax=b$ is a fill-in-the-blank exercise, while the proof for $xa=b$ you'll do on your own:

\begin{exercise}{48}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item 
Complete the proof that $ax=b$ has a unique solution by filling in the blanks:

Suppose that $ax = b$. First we must show that such an $x$ exists. Since $a \in G$ and $G$ is a group, it follows that $a^{-1}$ exists.
Multiplying both sides of $ax = b$ on the left by $a^{-1}$, we have 

\begin{align*}
a^{-1}(ax) & = a^{-1}b &\mbox{(left multiplication by $a^{-1}$)}\\
(a^{-1}a)x & = a^{-1}b  &(\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_) \\
ex & = a^{-1}b  &(\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_) \\
x & = a^{-1}b.  &(\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_)  
\end{align*} 
 
To show that the solution is unique, suppose that $x_1$ and $x_2$ are both solutions of $x_1  = a^{-1}b$ and $x_2  = a^{-1}b$. It follows that $x_1=x_2$, which implies that the solution is unique.

\item
Prove now the existence and uniqueness of the solution of $xa = b$ (similar to part (a)).
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise} 
 
The key method used in these proofs, the composition of both sides of the equation by $a^{-1}$, is something you've seen many times before.
For instance in high school algebra, to solve the equation $5x = 6$ above, we teach our kids to divide each side by 5.  Remember that dividing by 5 is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal $1/5$.  And $1/5$ is the multiplicative inverse of 5.  So in fact we are composing each side of the equation by $5^{-1}$ in order to solve for $x$.

As in our example then, composing both sides of the equation by $a^{-1}$ is not only useful for the proofs, but in actually solving for $x$.  Therefore, no matter what crazy elements and strange binary operation make up our group, we can still solve for $x$ using the same algebra we learned in high school.  In other words, given a group $G$ and $a,b \in G$,  if $ax =b$, then $x = a^{-1}b$; if $xa =b$, then $x = ba^{-1}$; and so on.  Use this methodology in the following exercises.    
 
\begin{exercise}{49}
Given $a, b \in {\mathbb C}^{\ast}$, where $a = 3 - 3i$ and $b = 2 + 12i$; solve for $x$ in each of the following equations.

\begin{exercise}{}

\textrm{(b)}~~x \ast 11 = -3\qquad\quad
\textrm{(c)}~~-3 \ast x = 11\qquad\quad

\]
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}{51}

In our work so far, we've frequently used the \term{substitution property}\index{Substitution property}.  For instance if $x = y$, then we know also that $a\cdot x = a \cdot y$, regardless of the operation $\cdot$.   But suppose I gave you the equation $a \cdot x = a \cdot y$.  Is it necessarily true that $x = y$?  If $a, x,y \in {\mathbb R}$ and the operation is multiplication, then it's true \emph{as long as $a \neq 0$}.  To show this, we may use  the method we talked about in the previous proposition:  multiply each side of the equation by $a^{-1}$ (that is, divide by a), and the result is $x = y$.  In basic algebra courses this property is often called the \term{law of cancellation}\index{Law of cancellation}.  
Now this works for real numbers: but suppose $a,x,y$ were elements of some other group.  Would the law of cancellation still hold?  In fact, using the method shown above, you can prove this property holds for any group $G$. 

\begin{prop}{cancel}
If $G$ is a group and $a, b, c \in G$, then $ba = ca$ implies $b = c$
and $ab = ac$ implies $b = c$. 
\end{prop} 
 
This proposition tells us that the \term{right and 
left cancellation laws}\index{Cancellation law!for
groups} are true in groups.  We leave the proof as an exercise.

\begin{exercise}{56}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item
To prove  Proposition~\ref{proposition:groups:cancel}, we need prove both  $ba = ca$ implies $b = c$  and $ab = ac$ implies $b = c$. Why do these two statements require two different proofs?
\item
Prove Proposition~\ref{proposition:groups:cancel}.
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise} 
 
We can use exponential notation for groups just as we do in ordinary
algebra:

\begin{defn}\label{DefGroupExponents}
 If $G$ is a group and $g \in G$, then we define $g^0 = e$.
For $n \in {\mathbb N}$, we define 
\[
g^n = \underbrace{g \cdot g \cdots g}_{n \; {\rm times}}
\]
and
\[
g^{-n} = \underbrace{g^{-1} \cdot g^{-1} \cdots g^{-1}}_{n
\; {\rm times}}.
\]
 \end{defn}
 
\begin{prop}{exponent_laws} \index{Exponent laws}
In a group, the usual laws of exponents hold; that is, for all $g, h
\in G$,
\begin{enumerate}
 
\item
$g^mg^n = g^{m+n}$ for all $m, n \in {\mathbb Z}$; 
 
\item
$(g^m)^n = g^{mn}$ for all $m, n \in {\mathbb Z}$; 
 
\item
$(gh)^n = (h^{-1}g^{-1})^{-n}$ for all $n \in {\mathbb Z}$. Furthermore,
if $G$ is abelian, then $(gh)^n = g^nh^n$. 
 
\end{enumerate}
\end{prop}
 
\begin{proof}
We will prove part (1), and you will do the rest. We can break part (1) into four cases: (a) $m,n \ge 0$; (b) $m,n < 0$; 
(c) $m \ge 0, n< 0$; (d) $m<0, n \ge 0$. 

Consider first case (a). 
Using Definition~\ref{DefGroupExponents}, we have
\[
g^m g^n = \underbrace{g \cdot g \cdots g}_{m \; {\rm times}}\underbrace{g \cdot g \cdots g}_{n \; {\rm times}},
\]
and
\[
g^{m+n} = \underbrace{g \cdot g \cdots g}_{m+n \; {\rm times}}.
\]
Since the right-hand sides of these expressions are equal, then so are the left-hand sides: so $g^mg^n = g^{m+n}$.

The proof of case (b) is exactly the same, except on the right-hand sides we should replace all $g$'s with $g^{-1}$ and we should also replace `$m$ times', `$n$ times', and `$m+n$ times' with `$-m$ times', `$-n$ times', and `$-(m+n)$ times' respectively.

In case (c), we have
\[
g^m g^n = \underbrace{g \cdot g \cdots g}_{m \; {\rm times}}\underbrace{g^{-1} \cdot g^{-1} \cdots g^{-1}}_{-n \; {\rm times}}.
\]
We now have two subcases to consider. First, if $m \ge -n$, then all of the $g^{-1}$ factors cancel and we end up with
\[
g^m g^n = \underbrace{g \cdot g \cdots g}_{m+n \; {\rm times}}.
\]
Second, if $m < -n$, then all of the $g$ factors are cancelled and we end up with
\[
g^m g^n = \underbrace{g^{-1} \cdot g^{-1} \cdots g^{-1}}_{-(m+n) \; {\rm times}}.
\]
In either of these subcases, the right-hand side agrees with the definition of $g^{m+n}$, so the equality is proved.

Case (d) is just like (c), except we exchange the signs  on the$g$'s,  $m$'s and $n$'s on the right-hand sides. This completes the proof of part (1).


\begin{exercise}{59}
Prove parts (2) and (3) of Proposition~\ref{proposition:groups:exponent_laws}.
\end{exercise}
\end{proof} 

Notice that $(gh)^n \neq g^nh^n$ in general, since the group may not be abelian.

If the group is ${\mathbb Z}$ or ${\mathbb Z}_n$, we write the group
operation additively and the exponential operation multiplicatively;
that is, we write $ng$ instead of $g^n$. The laws of exponents now
become 
\begin{enumerate}
 
\item
$mg + ng = (m+n)g$ for all $m, n \in {\mathbb Z}$;
 
\item
$m(ng) = (mn)g$ for all $m, n \in {\mathbb Z}$;
 
\item
$m(g + h) = mg + mh$ for all $m \in {\mathbb Z}$.
 
\end{enumerate}
It is important to realize that the last statement can be made only
because ${\mathbb Z}$ and  ${\mathbb Z}_n$ are abelian groups.

Although the first clear axiomatic definition of a group was not given

Joseph-Louis Lagrange\index{Lagrange, Joseph-Louis} used
group-theoretic methods in a 1770--1771 memoir to study methods of
solving polynomial equations.  Later, \'{E}variste
Galois\index{Galois, \'{E}variste} (1811--1832) succeeded in

\section{Subgroups}\label{groups_section_subgroups}

 We first came across subgroups in the Permutations chapter.  We saw that $S_n$, the set of permutations on a set of n elements, is a group under function composition.  Yet we also saw that the set of symmetries of an $n$-sided figure, which is a subset of $S_n$, is itself a group under function composition.  So a subgroup is a subset of a larger group that is itself a group under the same operation as the larger group.  Formally then: 

\begin{defn} \label{subgroup_defn}
A \term{subgroup}\index{Subgroup!definition of} $H$ of a group $(G,\circ)$ is a subset $H$ of $G$ such that when the group operation of $G$ is restricted to $H$, $H$ is a group in its own right. 
\end{defn}

By definition, all subgroups are subsets: but is the reverse true?\index{Subgroup!relation to subset} If not, what makes a sub\emph{set} a sub\emph{group}? What special  properties must subsets possess in order to qualify as subgroups?

The key to answering this question is the observation that any subset $H \subset G$ that is a subgroup of $G$ must also be a group in its own right: and we're already experts at deciding whether a set with a binary operation is a group: 

\begin{example}{Z2subgroup}
Consider the set of even integers $2{\mathbb Z} = \{ \ldots, -2, 0, 2, 4, \ldots \}$. A more mathematically concise definition is:
\[
2{\mathbb Z} = \{x \in {\mathbb Z} | x = 2n \mbox{ for some } n \in {\mathbb Z} \} \]

$2{\mathbb Z}$ is actually a subgroup of ${\mathbb Z}$, under the operation of addition. To show this, according to the definition of subgroup we need to show:

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item
$({\mathbb Z}, +)$ is a group;
\item
$2{\mathbb Z} \subset {\mathbb Z}$;
\item
$(2{\mathbb Z}, +)$ is a group.  
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
Items (a) and (b) can be dispatched in short order. 
From our work in Chapters 1 and 2, we know ${\mathbb Z}$ is a group under addition: this takes care of (a). For item (b), we have that any element   $m \in 2{\mathbb Z}$ can be written as $m=2n$, where $n \in {\mathbb Z}$: hence $m \in {\mathbb Z}$ also.

To show (c), we must verify all the group properties for $2{\mathbb Z}$ under the operation $+$:
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{(Closure)}: 
Given $x, y \in 2{\mathbb Z}$, it follows $x = 2n$ and $y = 2m$ for some $n, m \in {\mathbb Z}$.  Therefore
\[
x + y = 2n + 2m = 2(n + m) \]

Since ${\mathbb Z}$ is closed under $+$, it follows $(n + m) \in {\mathbb Z}$, so $2(n+m) \in 2{\mathbb Z}$. Since $x$ and $y$ were arbitrary, it follows that $2{\mathbb Z}$ is closed under addition.
\item \emph{(Associative)}:  
Suppose $w, x, y \in  2{\mathbb Z}$.  Then  $w, x, y$ are integers, and  
$w + (x + y) = (w + x) + y$ by the associativity of $({\mathbb Z}, +)$.  
Hence $2{\mathbb Z}$ is associative under addition.
\item \emph{(Identity)}: 
$0  \in  2{\mathbb Z}$, since $2 \cdot 0 = 0$: and for any $x \in  2{\mathbb Z}$, 
\medskip

$0 + x = x + 0 = x.$
\medskip

\noindent
Hence $ 2{\mathbb Z}$ has an identity under addition, namely $0$.
\item \emph{(Inverse)}: 
Given $x \in  2{\mathbb Z}$, where $x = 2n$,
\medskip

$-x = -(2n) = 2(-n),$  [associative and commutative properties of  ${\mathbb Z}$ under multiplication]
\medskip

\noindent
and since $-n \in {\mathbb Z}$ (closure of ${\mathbb Z}$ under multiplication) it follows that $-x \in 2{\mathbb Z}$. Now since
\medskip

$-x + x = x + (-x) = 0,$
\medskip

\noindent
it follows $\forall x \in 2{\mathbb Z}$, $\exists x^{-1} \in 2{\mathbb Z}$, namely $x^{-1} = -x$.
\end{itemize}

This completes the proof that  $2{\mathbb Z}$ is a subgroup of ${\mathbb Z}$ under addition.
\end{example}

\begin{exercise}{}
Given any fixed integer $m$ Prove that  $m{\mathbb Z} = \{ \ldots, -2m, -m,  0, m, 2m, \ldots \}$, is a subgroup of ${\mathbb Z}$ under the operation of addition.
\end{exercise}

%%%%%%%% CPT I think the following discussion is too long. When you revise, you should shorten it (or eliminate it)
%As mentioned above, this is a long proof, but if we look at how a subset can fail to be a subgroup, we can see how to shorten it.  To start, from our chapter already we can drum up some counterexamples.   In fact you might have been raising your hand saying, "ooh, ooh, aren't ${\mathbb R}^{\ast}$, ${\mathbb C}^{\ast}$, $GL_2({\mathbb R})$ and $U(n)$ subgroups?"  But in fact they aren't.  Why aren't they? 
It's also good to look at some examples that are \emph{not} subgroups:

\begin{exercise}{}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item
Explain why $({\mathbb R}, \cdot)$ is \emph{not} a group.
\item
Explain why ${\mathbb C}$ is not a group under complex multiplication.
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}
Notice that the operation used in the subgroup must be the \emph{same} operation that's used in the group it's contained in. For example,
${\mathbb R}^{\ast}$ is not a subgroup of ${\mathbb R}$, because  $({\mathbb R}^{\ast}, +)$ is not a group.


\begin{exercise}{64}
Prove or disprove:
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item
$GL_2({\mathbb R})$ is a subgroup of ${\mathbb M}_2 ( {\mathbb R})$.
\item
$U(n)$ is  a subgroup of ${\mathbb Z}_n$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}
 

% I took out the following discussion. It's too long, and the only result is that associativity doesn't need to be checked.
% So assuming $H \subset G$, $H$ is not a subgroup if $G$ if they are groups under different operations.  Also, trivially, if $H \notsubset G$, then $H$ obviously can't be a subgroup of $G$.

% Let's go ahead and assume these though.  Why else could a subset $H$ of $G$ not be a subgroup of $G$?  Well, lets go back to our definition and the properties of a group.  We know that $H$ must contain an identity to be a group.  Suppose $H \subset G$ that does not contain the identity of $G$, $e_G$.  Does $H$ have an identity?  Well, we know $e_G$ was the \emph{only} element in $G$ that acted like an identity; and $H$ isn't pulling from anywhere else to get its elements, or else $H \notsubset G$.  So $H$ does not  have an identity, and therefore can not be a group. Hence if the identity of $G$ is not in $H$, it can not be a subgroup of $G$.

% So now let's say $e_G \in H$.  What else could go wrong?  Every element in  $H$ must have an inverse for $H$ to be a group.  $(e_G)^{-1} = e_G$, so that's not a problem.  But suppose that among all the elements in $H$ there is one particular $g \in H$ such that $g^{-1} \notin H$.  Is there any other element in $H$ that can act as the inverse of $g$?  In fact we learned that $g^{-1}$ is unique; so if you don't include it in $H$, $g$ has no inverse, and therefore $H$ isn't a group.  Hence if $\exists h \in H$ such that $h^{-1} \notin H$, then $H$ can not be a subgroup of $G$.

% What else can go wrong.  Well $H$ needs to be associative under the operation $\circ$ of $G$ to be a group.  But all the elements of $G$ are associative under $\circ$, so since $H \subset G$, all the elements of $H$ are associative under $\circ$.  The subset ''inherits'' this property from the larger group $G$.  

% But what about closure.  All the elements of $G$ are closed under $\circ$; that is if $a,b \in G$, then $ab \in G$.  But now suppose $a,b \in H$ also.  Is $ab \in H$?  It may be, but it may not be.  We could pick two elements for $H$ whose composition is not in $H$, which would mean $H$ is not closed under $\circ$, which means $H$ is not a group.  All we really know is that $ab \in G$.  So if $\exists a,b \in H$ such that $ab \notin H$, then $H$ is not a subgroup of $G$.

% We realize then that if we prove $H \subset G$, instead of checking whether $H$ has all four properties of a group under $\circ$, we really only have to check three.  Finally we have our reduction of the subgroup proof.  To summarize:

We can make subgroup proofs a little easier. Notice that in Example~\ref{example:groups:Z2subgroup},  $2{\mathbb Z}$ was  associative simply by virtue of the fact that it's contained in the  group ${\mathbb Z}$ (with the same operation): so all of its elements must associate automatically. So we can simplify our list of things to check. This list is formalized in the following proposition (which is essentially proved by the forgoing discussion):

%\bigskip{}
%
%%% CPT I took this out (redundant)
%$H$ is a subgroup of a group $G$ if: 
%\begin{itemize}
%\item
%$H \subset G$,
%\item
% The identity of $G$ is in $H$, 
%\item
%All elements in $H$ have an inverse in $H$, 
%\item
%And $H$ is closed under the operation of $G$.
%\end{itemize}
%
%Formally then, and with proof (since our discussion only gives us the idea that this works, but doesn't prove it):
%
\begin{prop}{subgroup_prove}
A subset $H$ of a group $G$ is a subgroup if and only if it satisfies the
following conditions. \index{Subgroup!necessary conditions}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
 
 \item
The identity $e$ of $G$ is in $H$. 
 
\item
If $h_1, h_2 \in H$, then $h_1h_2 \in H$. 
 
\item
If $h \in H$, then $h^{-1} \in H$.
 
\end{enumerate}
\end{prop}
 
 %
%\begin{proof}
%First suppose that $H$ is a subgroup of $G$.  We must show that the three conditions hold.  Since $H$ is a group, it must have an identity $e_H$.  We must show that $e_H = e$, where $e$ is the identity of $G$. We know that $e_H e_H = e_H$ and that $ee_H = e_H e = e_H$; hence, %$ee_H = e_H e_H$.  By right-hand cancellation, $e =e_H$.  The second condition holds since a subgroup $H$ is a group.  To prove the third condition, let $h \in H$.  Since $H$ is a group, there is  an element $h' \in H$ such that $hh' = h'h = e$.  By the uniqueness  of the inverse in $G$, $h' = h^{-1}$.
%
%Conversely, if the three conditions hold, we must show that $H$ is a group under the same operation as $G$; however, these conditions plus the associativity of the binary operation are exactly the axioms stated in the definition of a group.

\end{exercise}

There is an alternative way to prove a subset $H$ of $G$ is a subgroup of $G$ that  can save some time.  It turns out that the three conditions in Proposition~\ref{proposition:groups:subgroup_prove} can be combined into a single statement:

\begin{prop}{subgroup_prove_2}
Let $H$ be a subset of a group $G$.  Then $H$ is a subgroup of $G$ if and only if $H \neq \emptyset$, and whenever $g, h \in H$ then $gh^{-1}$ is in $H$. 
\end{prop}
 
 
\begin{proof}
Let $H$ be a nonempty subset of $G$.  Then $H$ contains some element $g$.  So $gg^{-1} = e$ is in $H$.  If $g \in H$, then $eg^{-1} = g^{-1}$ is also in $H$. Finally, let $g, h \in H$. We must show that their product is also in $H$.  However, $g(h^{-1})^{-1} = gh \in H$.  Hence, $H$ is indeed a subgroup of $G$. Conversely, if $g$ and $h$ are in $H$, we want to show that $gh^{-1} \in H$.  Since $h$ is in $H$, its inverse $h^{-1}$ must also be in $H$.  Because of the closure of the group operation, $gh^{-1} \in H$. 
\end{proof}

\begin{example}{}
Using the proposition above, let's reprove that ${\mathbb T}$ is a subgroup of ${\mathbb C}^{\ast}$.

\begin{proof}
Based on the proposition, there are four things we need to show:
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item
${\mathbb C}^{\ast}$ is a group; 
\item
${\mathbb T} \neq \emptyset$; 
\item
${\mathbb T} \subset {\mathbb C}^{\ast}$; 
\item
Given $x, y \in {\mathbb T}$, $xy^{-1} \in {\mathbb T}$.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
Items (a), (b), and (c) we have shown before. As to item (d), 

$x, y \in {\mathbb T}$

$\implies |x|=1 \mbox{ and } |y|=1$

$\implies |xy^{-1}|= |x|\cdot|y^{-1}| = |x|/|y| = 1/1 = 1$

$\implies |xy^{-1}| \in {\mathbb T}$

%%% CPT I took the following out
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item
%By Exercise \ref{exercise:groups:C_star} we know ${\mathbb C}^{\ast}$ is a group under complex multiplication.
%\item
%$(1 + 0i) = 1 \in  {\mathbb T}$, since $| 1 + 0i | = 1$.  Hence  ${\mathbb T}$ is not an empty set.
%\item
%By definition of ${\mathbb T}$, if $x \in {\mathbb T}$, then $x \in {\mathbb C}$.  And $(0 + 0i) \notin {\mathbb T}$, since $| 0 + 0i | = 0$.  Therefore by definition, all $x$ in ${\mathbb T}$ are in ${\mathbb C}^{\ast}$.  Hence ${\mathbb T} \subset {\mathbb C}^{\ast}$.
%\item
%Finally, suppose $x, y \in {\mathbb T}$, where $x = a + bi$ and $y = c + di$.  
%
%\bigskip{}
%Then first,  $| x | = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = 1$;
%
%\bigskip{}
%and similarly,  $| y | = \sqrt{c^2 + d^2} = 1$.
%
%\bigskip{}
%Now $y^{-1} = \dfrac{c - di}{c^2 + d^2}$.  So, 
%\[
%xy^{-1} = (a + bi) \dfrac{c - di}{c^2 + d^2} = \dfrac{(ac +bd) + (cb -ad)i}{c^2 + d^2} \in {\mathbb C} \]
%
%and
%\[ | xy^{-1} | & = \sqrt{ \dfrac{(ac + bd)^2}{(c^2 + d^2)^2} + \dfrac{(cb - ad)^2}{(c^2 + d^2)^2}} \\
%& = \sqrt{ \dfrac{(ac + bd)^2 + (cb - ad)^2}{(c^2 + d^2)^2}} \\
%& = \sqrt{ \dfrac{a^2c^2 + b^2d^2 + 2acbd + c^2b^2 + a^2d^2 - 2cbad}{(c^2 + d^2)(c^2 + d^2)} \\
%& \= \sqrt{ \dfrac{a^2c^2 + b^2d^2 + c^2b^2 + a^2d^2}{(c^2 + d^2)(c^2 + d^2)} \\
%& = \sqrt{ \dfrac{(a^2 + b^2)c^2 + (a^2 + b^2)d^2}{(c^2 + d^2)(c^2 + d^2)} \\
%& = \sqrt{ \dfrac{(a^2 + b^2)(c^2 + d^2)}{(c^2 + d^2)(c^2 + d^2)} \\
%& = \sqrt{ \dfrac{(a^2 + b^2)}{(c^2 + d^2)} \\
%& = \dfrac{ \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}{ \sqrt{c^2 + d^2}} \\
%& = \dfrac{1}{1} \\
%& = 1 \]
%
%Hence $xy^{-1} \in {\mathbb T}$.
%\end{enumerate}
%
%Therefore ${\mathbb T}$ is a subgroup of ${\mathbb C}^{\ast}$.
\end{proof}

\section{Cyclic groups}
 
In this section we will explore an important property of some groups and subgroups.  

\subsection{Cyclic groups}

\begin{example}{construct_Z}
Consider the group ${\mathbb Z}$.  Let us try to find the smallest subgroup of ${\mathbb Z}$ that contains the number 1.
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
\item
We start with the smallest subset possible, $P = \{ 1 \}$.
\item
The subset has to be a group under addition.  But so far $P$ does not contain an additive identity.  So we need to add $0$ to the set, giving us $P = \{ 0, 1 \}$. 
\item
Zero is its own inverse under addition, but notice that our set does not include an inverse for $1$.  So we add $-1$ to $P$, giving us  $P = \{ -1, 0, 1 \}$.
\item
Is $P$ closed under addition?  Certainly when we add $0$ to $1$ and $-1$, we get $1$ and $-1$, respectively.  And $-1 + 1 = 0$.  But what about when we add $1$ and $1$, or $-1$ and $-1$?  So we need to add $2$ and $-2$ to the set, giving us $P = \{ -2, -1, 0, 1, 2 \}$.
\item
Now, what about $1 + 2$, or $(-1) + (-2)$?  So we need $3$ and $-3$, giving us $P = \{ -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3 \}$.
\item
And we can see that this process would keep going until we get all the integers.  In other words, 

\noindent
 $P = \{ \ldots, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots \} = {\mathbb Z}$.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
Therefore the smallest subgroup of $\mathbb Z$ that contains $1$ is $\mathbb Z$ itself.
\end{example}

\noindent
From the last example, we saw that $P$ was generated through repeated additions of $1$ and  repeated additions of $-1$ (with $0$ thrown in for good measure).  
Zero in fact can be calculated by adding $1$ and $-1$, and can be thought of as a zero multiple of $1$.  In addition,  the repeated additions of $1$ and $-1$ can be thought of 
as positive and negative multiples of $1$.  Therefore we can think of all the elements of $P$ as integer multiples of $1$.  We denote the set of all integer multiples of 1 as $\langle 1 \rangle$; therefore, 

\[ \langle 1 \rangle = \{ n \cdot 1 : n \in \mathbb Z \} = P. \]

\noindent
In Example ~\ref{example:groups:construct_Z} we also saw that $P$ was in fact $\mathbb Z$; therefore $\mathbb Z = \langle 1 \rangle$. We say that $\mathbb Z$ is \emph{generated by} $1$, as per the following definition:

Let us extend this concept to groups in general:

\begin{defn} Given a group $G$ and an element $a \in G$, then \term{the set  generated by the element} $a$\index{Set!generated by group element} is denoted by $\langle a \rangle$, and is defined as the set obtained by repeated 
operation on the identity $e$ by the group elements $a$ and $a^{-1}$.  Using the notation we introduced right before Proposition ~\ref{proposition:groups:exponent_laws}, we can write this as
\[ \langle a \rangle = \{ \ldots, a^{-3}, a^{-2}, a^{-1}, e, a, a^2, a^3, \ldots \} \]
\noindent
or
\[ \langle a \rangle = \{ a^{k} : k \in \mathbb Z \} \]
$\langle a \rangle$ is sometimes called the \term{orbit} of $a$.\index{Orbit! of a group element}
\end{defn}
\begin{rem}
If we are using the ``+'' operation, as in the case of the integers above, we write $\langle a \rangle  = \{ na : n \in {\mathbb Z} \}$.
\end{rem}

\begin{exercise}{}
List the set $\langle 3 \rangle$ for $3 \in {\mathbb R}^*$.
\end{exercise}

\noindent
We have special terminology for the case where all the elements of a group are generated by a single element:

\begin{defn}
 If a group $G$ contains some element $a$ such that $G = \langle a \rangle $, then $G$ is a
\term{cyclic group}\index{Group!cyclic}\index{Cyclic group}. In this case $a$ is a \term{
generator}\index{Generator! of a cyclic group}\index{Cyclic group!generator} of $G$.
\end{defn}

We have seen above that $1$ is a generator of $\mathbb Z$, and thus $\mathbb Z$ is a cyclic group.
A cyclic group may have more than one generator: 

\begin{exercise}{Z_construct_-1}
Show that $-1$ is a generator of $\mathbb Z$; that is that $\mathbb Z = \langle -1 \rangle$.
\end{exercise} 
 
\begin{example}{construct_Z6}
Consider the group ${\mathbb Z}_6$.  $\langle 1 \rangle$ is computed as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item
$1 \equiv 1$
\item
$1 + 1 \equiv 2$ 
\item
$1 + 1 + 1 \equiv 3$ 
\item
$1 + 1 + 1 + 1 \equiv 4$ 
\item
$1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 \equiv 5$ 
\item
$1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 \equiv 0$
\item
Notice that we've already generated all the elements in ${\mathbb Z}_6$. So we don't have to worry about finding the additive integer multiples of $1^{-1}$ (Note that $(1^{-1} = 5)$), because these calculations can't produce any new elements.
\item
So $\langle 1 \rangle = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 0 \} = {\mathbb Z}_6$.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
Therefore ${\mathbb Z}_6$ is a cyclic group generated by $1$.
\end{example}

\begin{exercise}{Z6_construct_5}
Show that $\langle 5 \rangle = {\mathbb Z}_6$.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}{82}
Given a group $G$, suppose that $G = \langle a \rangle$.  Prove that $G = \langle a^{-1} \rangle$.
\end{exercise}

\begin{example}{Cyclic_U9}
The group of units, $U(9)$ is a cyclic group.  As a
set, $U(9)$ is $\{ 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8  \}$. Computing $\langle 2 \rangle$, we get 

\begin{align*}
 \langle 2 \rangle &= \{ 2^1 \equiv 2, 2^2 \equiv 4, 2^3 \equiv 8, 2^4 \equiv 7, 2^5 \equiv 5, 2^6 \equiv 1 \} \\
 &= \{2, 4, 8, 7, 5, 1\} \\
 &= U(9)
 \end{align*}

\noindent
So $\langle 2 \rangle = \{ 2^n \pmod{9} : n \in \mathbb Z \} = U(9)$
\end{example}

\begin{exercise}{U9_construct}
Find any other generators of $U(9)$ if they exist (say so if none others exist).
\end{exercise}

\subsection{Cyclic subgroups}\label{CyclicSubgrups}
In this section we further explore properties of the set $\langle a \rangle$ for arbitrary group elements $a \in G$. We have seen that in some cases, $\langle a \rangle$ is actually  a group. We'll see in a minute that in fact $\langle a \rangle$ is \emph{always} a group. Let's look at some examples first.

\begin{example}{Cyclic_Z3}
Suppose that we consider $4 \in {\mathbb Z}$. 
\[
\langle 4 \rangle = \{ \ldots,-8, -4, 0, 4, 8, \ldots \}.
\]

\noindent
which happens to be the set $4 {\mathbb Z}$.

\begin{exercise}{subgroup_3Z}
Prove that $4 {\mathbb Z}$ is a subgroup of $\mathbb Z$.
\end{exercise}
It follows from this exercise that $4 {\mathbb Z}$ is the \emph{cyclic subgroup} of $\mathbb Z$ generated by $4$.
\end{example}


\begin{exercise}{87}
Let $H = \{ 2^n : n \in {\mathbb Z} \} = \langle 2 \rangle$ under multiplication.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item
List the elements in $H$
\item
Show that $H \subset {\mathbb Q}^*$.
\item
Show that $H$ is closed under multiplication.
\item
Show that $H$ is closed under inverse.
\item
Is $H$ a subgroup of $Q^*$? \emph{Explain} your answer.
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}
It follows from this exercise that   $H$ is the \emph{cyclic subgroup} of ${\mathbb Q}^*$ generated by 2.   

By now we've seen enough examples so that we're ready to prove the general result.

\begin{thm}\label{OrbitIsSubgroup}
Let $G$ be a group and $a$ be any element in $G$.  Then the set
\[
\langle a \rangle  = \{ a^k : k \in {\mathbb Z} \}\label{generatedby}
\]
is a subgroup of $G$.  Furthermore, $\langle a \rangle$ is the smallest subgroup of $G$ that contains~$a$. 
\end{thm}
 
 \begin{proof}
The identity is in $\langle a \rangle $ since $a^0 = e$. If $g$ and
$h$ are any two elements in $\langle a \rangle $, then by the
definition of $\langle a \rangle$ we can write $g = a^m$ and $h = a^n$
for some integers $m$ and $n$. So $gh = a^m a^n = a^{m+n}$ is again in
$\langle a \rangle $. Finally, if $g = a^n$ in $\langle a \rangle $,
then the inverse $g^{-1} = a^{-n}$ is also in $\langle a \rangle $.
Clearly, any subgroup $H$ of $G$ containing $a$ must contain all the
powers of $a$ by closure; hence, $H$ contains $\langle a \rangle $.
Therefore, $\langle a \rangle $ is the smallest subgroup of $G$
containing $a$. 
\end{proof}
 
\medskip
\begin{defn}
Given a group $G$, for each $a \in G$, we call $\langle a \rangle $ the \term{cyclic
subgroup}\index{Subgroup!cyclic} generated by $a$. 
\end{defn}
 
Let us now consider in particular the case of finite groups. Let $G$ be a finite group, and let $a$ be an element of $G$. Consider the set $A :=\left\{a, a^2, a^3, \ldots \right\}$. Since $A \subset G$ and $G$ is finite, the set $A$ must also be finite. In particular, the list 
$\left\{a, a^2, a^3, \ldots\right\}$ must contain duplicate elements, since otherwise $A$ would be infinite. We must therefore have $a^k = a^l$ for two different natural numbers $k,l$. This is the key fact in proving the following exercise:

\begin{exercise}{90}
Let $G$ be a finite group, and let $a \in G$ where $a \neq e$. Show there exists a natural number $m>0$ such that $a^m = e$.
\hyperref[sec:groups:hints]{(*Hint*)}
\end{exercise}
In view of the preceding exercise, we may make the following definition:

\begin{defn}\label{DefOrder}
If $a$ is an element of a group $G$, we define the \term{order}\index{Element!order
of} of $a$ to be the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $a^n= e$,
and we write $|a| = n$\label{noteelementorder}. If there is no such
integer $n$, we say that the order of $a$ is infinite and  write $|a|
= \infty$ to denote the order of $a$. \footnote{Yet another use of the term ``order" and the absolute value sign.  But you should be used to it by now.}
\end{defn} 

\begin{example}{Z_1_order}
Let us consider the orders of different elements in the infinite group $\mathbb Z$.
\begin{itemize}
\item
First, what is $| 0 |$?  According to Definition~\ref{DefOrder}, we need to find the smallest positive integer such that $n \cdot 0 = 0$  (remember, $\mathbb Z$ is an \emph{additive} group. We get $n=1$, so $| 0 | =1$, and the cyclic subgroup generated by $0$ is $\langle 0 \rangle = \{ 0 \}$
\item
What is $| 1 |$?  $1 + 1 = 2$; $1 + 1 + 1 = 3$; $\ldots$  In fact you'll never get to $0$ adding a positive number of ones.  So $| 1 | = \infty$, and as we've seen, $\langle 1 \rangle = \mathbb Z$.
\item
Similarly, $| -1 | = \infty$.
\end{itemize}
\end{example}

\begin{exercise}{Z6_orders}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item
In the group ${\mathbb Z}_6$, What is $| 1 |$? What is $| 5 |$?
\item
 Given any group $G$, If $e$ is the identity element of $G$ then what is $|e|$?
\end{enumerate}
 \end{exercise}

\begin{example}{Cyclic_Z6}
The order of $2 \in {\mathbb Z}_6$ is 3, because under repeated modular addition we have
\[
2 \oplus 2 = 4;\qquad  2 \oplus  2 \oplus  2 = 0.\]

\noindent
Therefore the cyclic subgroup generated by 2 is $\langle 2 \rangle  = \{ 0, 2, 4\}$.  
\end{example}

\begin{exercise}{U9_orders}
Find the orders and cyclic subgroups generated by each element of $U(9)$.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}{OrderEltCyclic}
We have defined the order of $a$ (denoted by $|a|$) as the smallest natural number such that $a^n = e$. On the other hand, we have $| \langle a \rangle |$ is equal to the order of the cyclic subgroup generated by $a$. Which is larger, $|a|$ or $| \langle a \rangle |$? \emph{Explain} your answer.
\end{exercise}
\begin{exercise}{97}
Let $G$ be a finite group, and let $a \in G$ such that $|a| = n$ for $n>0$. Show that there exists a natural number $m$ such that $a^{-1} = a^m$, and express $m$ in terms of $n$.
\end{exercise}
 
\begin{example}{Not_Cyclic_S3}
Not every group is a cyclic group.  Consider the symmetry group of an
equilateral triangle $S_3$.  $S_3$ has 6 elements: we saw the Cayley table for $S_3$ in the Symmetries chapter.  You may verify by using the table that no single element generates the entire group.
The subgroups of $S_3$ are shown in
Figure~\ref{subgrpsS3}.  You may verify  that every subgroup is cyclic.

However, we can prove that:
 
\begin{thm}
Every cyclic group is abelian.
\end{thm}
 
 
\begin{proof}
Let $G$ be a cyclic group and $a \in G$ be a generator for $G$. If
$g$ and $h$ are in $G$, then they can be written as powers of $a$,
say $g = a^r$ and $h = a^s$. Since
\[
g  h = a^r a^s = a^{r+s} = a^{s+r} = a^s a^r = h g,
\]
$G$ is abelian.
\end{proof}
 
 
 
\subsection{Subgroups of cyclic groups}
 
 
We can ask some interesting questions about cyclic subgroups of a
group and subgroups of a cyclic group.  If $G$ is a group, which
subgroups of $G$ are cyclic? If $G$ is a cyclic group, what type of
subgroups does $G$ possess? 
 
 
 
\begin{thm}
Every subgroup of a cyclic group is cyclic.
\end{thm}
 
 
\begin{proof}
The main tools used in this proof are the division algorithm and the
Principle of Well-Ordering. Let $G$ be a cyclic group generated by $a$
and suppose that $H$ is a subgroup of $G$. If $H = \{ e \}$, then
trivially $H$ is cyclic. Suppose that $H$ contains some other element
$g$ distinct from the identity. Then $g$ can be written as
$a^n$ for some integer $n$. We can assume that $n > 0$. Let $m$ be the
smallest natural number such that $a^m \in H$. Such an $m$ exists by
the Principle of Well-Ordering.\index{Principle of Well-Ordering}
 
 
We claim that $h = a^m$ is a generator for $H$.  We must show that
every $h' \in H$ can be written as a power of $h$. Since $h' \in H$
and $H$ is a subgroup of $G$, $h' = a^k$ for some positive integer
$k$. Using the division algorithm, we can find numbers $q$ and $r$
such that $k = mq +r$ where $0 \leq r < m$; hence,
\[
a^k = a^{mq +r} = (a^m)^q a^r = h^q a^r.
\]
So we can solve for $a^r$:  $a^r =h^{-q}  a^k $. Since $a^k$ and $h^{-q}$ are in $H$, $a^r$ must
also be in $H$.  However, $m$ was the smallest positive number such that
$a^m$ was in $H$; consequently, $r=0$ and so $k=mq$. Therefore, 
\[
h' = a^k = a^{mq} =  h^q
\]
and $H$ is generated by $h$.
\end{proof}
 
 
\begin{corollary}
The subgroups of ${\mathbb Z}$ are exactly $n{\mathbb Z}$ for $n = 0, 1, 2,
\ldots$. 
\end{corollary}
 
 
\begin{thm}\label{Cyclic_subgrp_order}
Let $G$ be a cyclic group of order $n$ and suppose that $a$ is a
generator for  $G$. Then $a^k=e$ if and only if $n$ divides $k$.
\end{thm}
 
 
\begin{proof}
First suppose that $a^k=e$. By the division algorithm, $k = nq + r$
where $0 \leq r < n$; hence, 
\[
e = a^k = a^{nq + r} = a^{nq} a^r = (a^n)^q a^r =e^q a^r = a^r.
\]
Since the smallest positive integer $m$ such that $a^m = e$ is $n$, it follows that $r$ cannot be a positive integer. So $r
= 0$ is the only possibility.
 
 
Conversely, if $n$ divides $k$, then $k=ns$ for some integer $s$.
Consequently, 
\[
a^k = a^{ns} = (a^n)^s = e^s = e.
\]
\end{proof}
 
 
\begin{thm}
Let $G$ be a cyclic group of order $n$ and suppose that $a \in G$ is a
generator of the group.  If $b = a^k$, then the order of $b$ is $n
/d$, where $d = \text{gcd}(k,n)$. 
\end{thm}
 
 
\begin{proof}
We wish to find the smallest integer $m$ such that $e = b^m = a^{km}$.
By Proposition~\ref{Cyclic_subgrp_order}, this is the smallest integer $m$ such that
$n$ divides $km$ or, equivalently, $n/d$ divides $m(k/d)$. (Note that $n/d$ and $k/d$ are both integers, since $d$ divides both $n$ and $k$.)  Since $d$ is
the greatest common divisor of $n$ and $k$, $n/d$ and $k/d$ are
relatively prime. Hence, for $n/d$ to divide $m(k/d)$ it must divide
$m$.  The smallest such $m$ is $n/d$. 
\end{proof}
 
 
\begin{corollary}
The generators of ${\mathbb Z}_n$ are the integers $r$ such that $1 \leq
r < n$ and $\text{gcd}(r,n) =  1$. 
\end{corollary}
 
 
\begin{example}{Cyclic_Z16}
Let us examine the group ${\mathbb Z}_{16}$.  The numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, 9,
11, 13, and 15 are the elements of ${\mathbb Z}_{16}$ that are relatively
prime to 16.  Each of these elements generates ${\mathbb Z}_{16}$. For
example, 
\begin{alignat*}{3}
1 \cdot 9  & =  9  & \qquad 2 \cdot 9  & = 2  & \qquad 3 \cdot 9  & = 11 \\
4 \cdot 9  & =  4  & \qquad 5 \cdot 9  & = 13 & \qquad	6 \cdot 9 & = 6  \\
7 \cdot 9  & =  15 & \qquad 8 \cdot 9  & = 8  & \qquad	9 \cdot 9 &  = 1  \\
10 \cdot 9 & =  10 & \qquad 11 \cdot 9 & = 3  & \qquad	12 \cdot 9 &  = 12 \\
13 \cdot 9 & =  5 &  \qquad 14 \cdot 9 & = 14 &  \qquad	15 \cdot 9 & = 7.
\end{alignat*}
\end{example}
